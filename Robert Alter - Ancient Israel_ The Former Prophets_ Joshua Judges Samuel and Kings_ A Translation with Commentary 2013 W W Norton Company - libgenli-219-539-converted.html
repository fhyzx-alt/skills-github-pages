And she was deeply embittered, and she prayed to the L<span class="s13">ORD</span>, weeping all the while. And she vowed a vow and said, “L<span class="s13">ORD </span><a href="#bookmark28" class="s11">of Armies, if you really will look on your servant’s woe and remember me, and forget not your servant and give your servant male seed, </a><a href="#bookmark28" class="s12">I will give him to the L</a><span class="s15">ORD </span><a href="#bookmark29" class="s11">all the days of his life, </a><a href="#bookmark29" class="s12">no razor shall touch his </a><span style=" color: #00F;">head</span>.” And it happened as she went on with her prayer before the L<span class="s13">ORD</span>, with Eli watching her mouth, as Hannah was speaking in her heart, her lips alone moving and her voice not heard, Eli thought she was drunk.

And they rose early in the morning and bowed before the L<span class="s13">ORD </span>and returned and came to their home in Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife and the L<span class="s13">ORD </span><a href="#bookmark32" class="s11">remembered her.

First the main character, or characters, are identified by name, pedigree, and geographical location. The only verb used is “to be” (verses 1–2). In this instance the standard biblical story beginning, “there was a man,” is in part a false lead because the real protagonist of the story is Elkanah’s wife Hannah. Then there is a series of reported actions in the iterative tense</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">—that is, an indication of habitually repeated actions (verses 3–7). (In all this, compare Job 1.) The narrative then zooms in to a particular moment, one of those annually repeated events of Hannah’s frustration at Shiloh, by way of Elkanah’s dialogue (verse 8), which could not plausibly be an iterative event. At this point, we have moved from prelude to story proper. The writer himself seems quite conscious of this play between recurring units of time and specific moments in time: the word <i>yamim</i>, “days,” but often</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">as in verse 3 with the sense of “annual cycle,” is used five times, together with the singular <i>yom</i>, in an iterative sense, at the beginning of verse 4. (These recurrences are complemented by “year after year,” <i>shanah beshanah</i>, in verse 7.)</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark0" class="s27" name="bookmark22">2. </a><a href="#bookmark0" class="a">And he had two </a>wives<span class="p">. The reference to two wives, one childbearing, the other childless, immediately alerts the audience to the unfolding of the familiar annunciation type-scene. The expected sequence of narrative motifs of the annunciation scene is the report of the wife’s barrenness (amplified by the optional motif of the fertile co-wife less loved by the husband than is the childless wife); the promise, through oracle or divine messenger or man of God, of the birth of a son; cohabitation resulting in conception and birth. As we shall see, the middle motif is articulated in a way that is distinctive to the concerns of the Samuel story.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1" class="s27" name="bookmark23">3. </a>the two sons of Eli<span class="p">. The reference is initially puzzling but points forward to the focus on proper and improper heirs to the priesthood in Samuel’s story.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2" class="s27" name="bookmark24">5. </a><a href="#bookmark2" class="a">And to Hannah he would give one double </a><span class="s20">portion</span>. The Hebrew phrase, which occurs only  here,  means  literally  “one  portion  [for  the?]  face,”  and  has perplexed commentators. The conclusion of several modern translators that the phrase means “only a single portion” makes nonsense out of the following words that the allotment was an expression of Elkanah’s special love. It seems wisest to follow a long tradition of commentators who take a cue from the doublative ending of ’<i>apayim</i>, the word for “face” (perhaps even a textual corruption for another word meaning “double”) and to construe this as a double portion to Hannah who, alas, unlike Peninnah, has no children.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark3" class="s27" name="bookmark25">7. </a><a href="#bookmark3" class="a">And thus was it </a>done<span class="p">.

All the annunciation stories must be understood in light of the prevalent ancient Near Eastern view that a woman’s one great avenue to fulfillment in life was through the bearing of sons. It is noteworthy that Hannah does not respond to Elkanah. When she does at last speak, it is to God.</span></p><p class="s32" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark6" class="s27" name="bookmark28">11. </a><a href="#bookmark6" class="a">I will give him to the L</a>ORD<span class="p">. Hannah’s prayer exhibits a directness of style, without ornament or conventional liturgical phrasing, and an almost naive simplicity: if you give him to me, I will give him to you. This canceling out of the two givings is reconciled by the introduction of another verb at the end of the story: Hannah “lends” to God the child He has given her.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark7" class="a" name="bookmark29">no razor shall touch his </a>head<span class="p">. As an expression of her dedication of the prayed-for child, Hannah vows that he will be a nazirite (like Samson), a person specially</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">dedicated to God who took a vow of abstinence from certain activities. (The literal meaning of the Hebrew is “no razor will go up on his head.”) The nazirites also refrained from wine, which throws an ironic backlight on Eli’s subsequent accusation that Hannah is drunk. A few biblical texts link nazirite and prophet.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark8" class="s27" name="bookmark30">14. </a><a href="#bookmark8" class="a">How long will you go on </a>drunk? <span class="p">The central annunciation motif of the type-scene is purposefully distorted. Since Hannah receives no direct response from God—she prays rather than inquires of an oracle—Eli the priest should be playing the role of man of God or divine intermediary. But at first he gets it all wrong, mistaking her silent prayer for drunken mumbling, and denouncing her in a poetic line (marked by semantic and rhythmic parallelism) of quasi-prophetic verse. When in verse 17 he accepts her protestation of innocent suffering, he piously prays or predicts—the Hebrew verb could be construed either way—that her petition will be granted, but he doesn’t have a clue about the content of the petition. The uncomprehending Eli is thus virtually a parody of the annunciating figure of the conventional type-scene—an apt introduction to a story in which the claim to authority of the house of Eli will be rejected, and ultimately, sacerdotal guidance will be displaced by prophetic guidance in the person of Samuel, who begins as a temple acolyte but then exercises a very different kind of leadership.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark9" class="s27" name="bookmark31">15. </a>bleak-spirited<span class="p">.

There is a small puzzlement in the Hebrew because it is the name Saul, <i>Sha’ul</i>, not Samuel, <i>Shmu’el</i>, that means “asked” (or “lent”). This has led some modern scholars to speculate that a story originally composed to explain the birth of Saul was transferred to Samuel—perhaps because Saul’s eventual unworthiness to reign made it questionable that he should merit a proper annunciation scene. But it must be said that the only evidence for this speculation is the seeming slippage of names here. That could easily be explained, as by the thirteenth-century Hebrew commentator David Kimchi, if we assume Hannah is playing on two Hebrew words, <i>sha’ul me’el</i>, “asked of God.” In any case, biblical writers allowed themselves considerable license in etymologizing names.</p></li><li data-list-text="21."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark33">&zwnj;</a>the yearly sacrifice<span class="p">. The annual cycle of iterative actions invoked at the beginning is seemingly resumed, but everything is different now that Hannah has borne a son, and she herself introduces a change in the repeated pattern.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark34">&zwnj;</a><span class="s20">votive pledge</span>. Although this is the same Hebrew term, <i>neder</i>, that is used for Hannah’s vow at the beginning of verse 11, its most likely referent here is a vowed thanksgiving offering on the part of the husband for his wife’s safe delivery of a son.</p></li><li data-list-text="22."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark35">&zwnj;</a><span class="s20">Till the lad is weaned</span>. The word for “lad,” <i>na‘ ar</i>, is quite often a tender designation of a young son. Though it typically refers to an adolescent, or even to a young man at the height of his powers (David uses it for the usurper Absalom), it evidently can also be used for an infant. Nursing and weaning (compare the end of this verse and the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">beginning of the next verse) are insisted on here with a peculiar weight of repetition and literalness. This usage surely intimates the powerful biological bond between Hannah and the longed-for baby and thus points to the pain of separation she must accept, whatever the postponement, according to the terms of her own vow. In the Ark Narrative that follows, there will be a surprising recurrence of this image of nursing mothers yearning for their young. At this point, the only other indication of her feelings about the child is the term “lad” that she uses for him.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark14" class="a" name="bookmark36">we will see the L</a><a href="#bookmark14" class="s21">ORD</a><a href="#bookmark14" class="a">’</a><a href="#bookmark14" class="s21">S </a><span class="s20">presence</span>. Or, even more concretely, “the L<span class="s22">ORD</span>’<span class="s22">S </span>face.” The anthropomorphism of this ancient idiom troubled the later transmitters of tradition sufficiently so that when vowel points were added to the consonantal text, roughly a millennium after the biblical period, the verb “we will see” (<i>nir’eh</i>) was revocalized as <i>nir’ah </i>(“he will be seen”), yielding a more chastely monotheistic “he will appear in the L<span class="s22">ORD</span>’<span class="s22">S </span>presence.”</p></li><li data-list-text="23."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark37">&zwnj;</a>what your mouth has uttered<span class="p">. The Masoretic text has “His word.” But a fragment of Samuel found in Cave 4 at Qumran reads “what your mouth has uttered,” which, referring directly to Hannah’s vow at Shiloh, makes much better sense since God, after all, has made no promises.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="24."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark16" class="a" name="bookmark38">a three-year-old </a>bull<span class="p">. This is again the reading of the Qumran Samuel text. The Masoretic text has “three bulls,” but only one bull is sacrificed in the next verse, and three-year-old beasts were often designated for sacrifice.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="25."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark17" class="a" name="bookmark39">they slaughtered the bull . . . they brought the </a><span class="s20">lad</span>. The plural subject of these verbs is evidently Elkanah and Hannah. The simple parallelism of the brief clauses is eloquent: both the bull and the child are offerings to the L<span class="s22">ORD</span>, and Samuel’s dedication to the sanctuary is, surely for the parents, a kind of sacrifice. It may be relevant that the term “lad,” <i>na ‘ar</i>, is precisely the one used for Isaac when he is on the point of being sacrificed and for Ishmael when he is on the brink of perishing in the wilderness. Perhaps that background of usage also explains the odd insistence on “the lad was but a lad” at the end of the preceding verse. Given the late weaning time in the ancient world, and given Hannah’s likely impulse to postpone that difficult moment, one might imagine the child Samuel to be around the age of four or five.</p></li><li data-list-text="26."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark40">&zwnj;</a>Please, my lord<span class="p">.

The reference to the anointed king at the end of the poem assumes the institution of the monarchy, not established until two generations after the moment when Hannah is said to have pronounced this prayer. It is clearly the invocation in verse 5 of the barren woman who bears seven that encouraged the introduction here of this particular text. But the larger thematic assertion in the poem of God’s power to reverse fortunes, plunging the high to the depths and exalting the lowly, is a fitting introduction to the whole Saul-David history. This psalm (verses 1–10) and David’s victory psalm (2 Samuel 22) echo each other and act as formal “bookends” to the extended narrative sequence that includes the stories of Samuel, Saul, and David.</p><ol id="l2"><li data-list-text="1."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="#bookmark44" class="a" name="bookmark67">my horn is raised </a>high<span class="p">.

The idea seems to be</span></p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">that the animal’s horn is its glory and power, held high, perhaps in triumph after goring an enemy into submission. There is a sequence of body parts at the beginning of the first three versets of the poem, two literal and the middle one metaphorical: “my heart,” “my horn,” “my mouth.” The raising high of the horn is crucial to the thematic unfolding of the poem, which reiterates a pattern of vertical movement, elevation and descent, that manifests God’s power to reverse the fortunes of humankind. The upraised horn at the beginning returns in the envelope structure of the last line, a prayer that the L<span class="s22">ORD </span>“raise high His anointed’s horn.” That final image, in turn, involves a hidden pun, because the Hebrew “horn” (<i>qeren</i>, actually one of the rare Semitic terms cognate with Indo-European—<i>cornu/horn</i>) is also the receptacle containing the oil with which the king is anointed.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark45" class="a" name="bookmark68">My mouth is wide to bolt down my </a>foes<span class="p">.

The verb used is restricted to poetry; a noun derived from it means “rubble” or “tiny broken fragments,” hence the sense seems to be more extreme than the standard term “to break.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark47" class="s27" name="bookmark70">5. </a><a href="#bookmark47" class="a">the hungry cease </a><span class="s20">evermore</span>. The Masoretic text is rather cryptic. This translation revocalizes the last Hebrew word of the line ‘<i>ad </i>(“until,” or, by a long conjectural stretch, “prey”) as ‘<i>od</i>, an adverb indicating persistence through time. The Masoretes attached the word to the beginning of the next clause, where, however, its semantic function is equally unclear.</p><ol id="l3"><li data-list-text="8."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark48" class="a" name="bookmark71">to seat among </a><span class="s20">princes</span>. The language here might anticipate the monarchic flourish at the end of the poem. “Throne” <i>(kis’ei) </i>in the next line can mean either throne or chair. Robert Polzin has made an elaborate argument for seeing not only Hannah’s prayer but all the early chapters of 1 Samuel as a grand foreshadowing of the fate of the monarchy with the old and failing Eli, who will die falling off his chair or throne, as a stand-in for the Davidic kings.</p></li><li data-list-text="9."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark49" class="a" name="bookmark72">the wicked in darkness turn </a><span class="s20">dumb</span>. The verb obviously refers to death—the underworld in other psalms is sometimes called <i>dumah</i>, the realm of silence or speechlessness, a noun cognate with the verb <i>yidamu </i>used here.

The Masoretic text reads, “L<span class="s22">ORD</span>, Your adversaries are shattered.” But the Samuel fragment from Qumran has God as the subject of a verb in the singular (a difference of only one letter) with the adversaries as the object. This makes better syntactic sense, especially since it is God who is thundering against the enemies in the second half of the line. The verb <i>shatter </i>is the same one used for the warriors’ bow in verse 4.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark51" class="s27" name="bookmark74">14. </a>the cauldron or the pot or the vat or the kettle<span class="p">. This catalogue of implements is quite untypical of biblical narrative (and in fact the precise identification of the sundry cooking receptacles is unsure). The unusual specification serves a satiric purpose: Eli’s sons are represented in a kind of frenzy of gluttony poking their three-pronged forks into every imaginable sort of pot and pan. This sense is then heightened in the aggressiveness of the dialogue that follows, in which Eli’s sons insist on snatching the meat uncooked from the worshippers, not allowing them, as was customary, first to burn away the fat.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark52" class="s27" name="bookmark75">18. </a>ephod. <span class="p">A short garment, chiefly of linen, worn by priests.

This is a poignant instance of the expressive reticence of biblical narrative.

This minimal notation of Hannah’s annual gesture of making a little cloak for the son she has “lent” to the L<span class="s22">ORD </span>beautifully intimates the love she preserves for him. The garment, fashioned as a gift of maternal love, stands in contrast to the ephod, the acolyte’s official garb for his cultic office. Moreover, the robe (<i>me‘il</i>) will continue to figure importantly in Samuel’s life, and even in his afterlife, as we shall have occasion to see.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark77">&zwnj;</a>year after year. <span class="p">The phrase takes us back to the iterative tense of the beginning of the story.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark55" class="s27" name="bookmark78">22. </a>and that they lay with the women<span class="p">. This whole clause is missing in the Qumran scroll and in one version of the Septuagint; in fact, sexual exploitation was not mentioned in the initial narrative report of the sons’ misdeeds. There is, however, a consonance between their appetitive impulse in snatching the meat and grabbing the women, perhaps reinforced by the satiric, and phallic, image of thrusting forks into bubbling pots.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark79">&zwnj;</a>flocked. <span class="p">The Hebrew verb might also mean “ministered.”</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark57" class="s27" name="bookmark80">27. </a><a href="#bookmark57" class="a">a man of God came to </a>Eli<span class="p">. This enunciation of a curse on the house of Eli, at the very beginning of the Samuel story, is introduced at precisely the corresponding place in the narrative as the denunciation and admonition of the divine messenger at the beginning of Judges (Chapter 2). An analogous curse will be pronounced by Nathan the prophet on the house of David (2 Samuel 12) and will be enacted in the subsequent narrative.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark81">&zwnj;</a>slaves to Pharaoh’s house<span class="p">.

Several points in the curse pronounced by the man of God look textually defective.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark60" class="s27" name="bookmark83">30. </a>will walk before Me<span class="p">.

The received text at this point is very doubtful, yielding, literally, a nonsense chain: “you will look narrow habitation.” This translation adopts an emendation that has considerable scholarly currency: ‘<i>ayin </i>instead of <i>ma ‘on </i>(a difference of one consonant in the Hebrew). That yields the idiom <i>tsar- ‘ayin, </i>“jealously” or “with a jaundiced eye.” But the Qumran text and one version of the Septuagint lack the entire clause.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark63" class="s27" name="bookmark86">33. </a>no man of you will I cut off<span class="p">. The usual understanding of these words is that God will leave them alive to witness in pain the destruction of the family. This interpretation seems a bit strained because in the next verse God promises to destroy both of Eli’s sons on a single day. Perhaps the clause originally read, “every man of you will I cut off,” though this phrasing is not reflected in any of the ancient versions.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark64" class="a" name="bookmark87">fall by the sword of </a>men<span class="p">.

The Hebrew <i>kihah </i>occurs only here as a transitive verb in the <i>pi‘el </i>conjugation, though it is fairly common as an intransitive verb in the <i>qal </i>conjugation, meaning “to grow weak,” “to become dark,” or, as with the eyes of Eli in verse 2, bleary. The transitive sense of the verb would then be something like “to incapacitate,” to prevent someone from doing something. Its unusual usage in this sentence is obviously meant to align Eli’s failing in parental authority with the failing of his sight.</p></li><li data-list-text="11."><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark100" class="s27" name="bookmark121">–13. </a><a href="#bookmark100" class="s24">It is noteworthy that </a>God’s <span style=" color: #000;">first message to Samuel is a prophecy of doom.

The Philistines were part of the general incursion of the so-called Sea Peoples from the Aegean—the prophet Amos names Crete as their land of origin— into the eastern Mediterranean region perhaps less than a century before the early eleventh-century setting of our story. (There is some evidence that they first migrated to Anatolia, then moved southward.) They established a powerful presence in Canaan on the coastal plain, concentrated in the region a little south of present-day Tel Aviv. They were intrepid warriors (note the martial exhortation of verse 9) and also exercised a mastery of military science and military technology. In the coastal plain, they were able to deploy iron chariots (which seem to have been lacking among the Israelites) as well as infantry. Perhaps their failure to extend their mini-kingdom of five allied cities more than a dozen or so miles eastward from the coast was related to a loss of the strategic advantage of chariots as they went up into the high country.</span></p><ol id="l6"><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark133" class="a" name="bookmark156">the Philistines drew up their lines . . . and the battle forces were </a>deployed<span class="p">.

The Hebrew phrase behind “by the road” is textually problematic, as is the related phrase attached to the word “gate” in verse 18. Scholarly opinion differs as to whether Eli is sitting by the road, by the gate, or, like David in 2 Samuel 18, above the gate. The last of these possibilities would best explain his breaking his neck when he falls, but it is by no means the inevitable meaning of the Hebrew, and the Hebrew preposition in verse 18 actually indicates <i>through </i>the gate.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark146" class="a" name="bookmark169">his heart was trembling over the Ark of </a>God<span class="p">.

The Hebrew name is conventionally construed to mean “Inglorious,” though Kyle McCarter, Jr., has argued that the more probable meaning is “Where is glory?” or “Alas for glory!” In any case, it is a most peculiar name—the dying mother, overcome by the loss of the Ark (which affects her much more than her husband’s demise), inscribing the national catastrophe in her son’s name. Where one must agree unhesitatingly with McCarter is that the verb in this verse and the next should be rendered as “exiled” and not, as it is customarily translated, as “departed.” Exile is what it clearly denotes, and it is surely significant that this whole large sequence of stories that will provide an account of the founding of Israel’s dynasty and the crystallization of its national power begins with a refrain of glory exiled from Israel. It is also noteworthy that the term for “glory,” <i>kavod, </i>is transparently cognate with <i>kaved, </i>“heavy,” the adjective used to explain Eli’s lethal tumble from his chair—the leader who might be supposed to represent Israel’s glory exhibits only deadly heaviness.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">CHAPTER 5</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark191" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 30pt;" name="bookmark178">A</a><a href="#bookmark191" class="s6">nd the Philistines had taken the Ark of God and brought it </a><a href="#bookmark191" class="s5">from Eben-Ezer to Ashdod</a><a href="#bookmark191" class="s6">.

This clause and the parallel one in the next verse reflect the visual perspective of the Ashdodites when they come into the temple early in the morning and make their shocking discovery.

The Masoretic text has cryptically, “Dagon alone remained on him,” but several of the ancient translations appear to have used a version which read <i>geivo, </i>“his trunk,” instead of <i>Dagon</i>. Dagon’s first downfall might be attributed to a natural, accidental cause—the idol’s somehow slipping from its pedestal. This second incident, in which the hands and head of the idol have been chopped off, offers to the Philistines clear proof of divine intervention. Hacking the hands and feet off war prisoners was a well-known barbaric practice in the ancient Near East, and similar acts of mutilation are attested in the Book of Judges.</p></li><li data-list-text="5."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark196">&zwnj;</a>Therefore<span class="p">.

Many translations render this as “hemorrhoids,” and there is a little confusion in the Masoretic text: the consonantal written version (<i>ketiv</i>) has “tumors,” but the tradition for reciting the text (<i>qeri</i>) indicates “hemorrhoids.” This confusion is compounded because the Septuagint, seconded by Josephus, includes a plague of mice not in evidence in the Masoretic version, and the golden mice of the next chapter look</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">very much like a response to just such a plague. The fact, moreover, that hemorrhoids are a humiliating but not lethal disorder and are not spread by epidemic, whereas the Philistines protest that they are dying, gives support to an interpretation at least as old as Rashi: the plague in question is bubonic plague, carried by rats (metamorphosed in this story into mice, and associated with the epidemic but perhaps not clearly understood as the bearers of the disease); the tumors are the <i>buboes </i>of bubonic plague, which might especially afflict the lower body, including the rectal area.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark186" class="s27" name="bookmark198">8. </a><span class="s20">overlords</span>. The Hebrew term <i>seranim </i>is a Philistine loanword and is applied only to Philistines as a touch of local color (like calling Spanish aristocrats “grandees”).

Since there is only one <i>seren </i>for each Philistine city, they are clearly more than just “lords.”</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark199">&zwnj;</a>Gath<span class="p">.

Instead of the sharply etched individual characters of the surrounding narrative, we have only collective speakers and agents. Instead of the political perspective with its human system of causation, the perspective is theological and the culminating events of the story are frankly miraculous. God, Who does not speak in this narrative, manifests His power over Philistines and Israelites alike through supernatural acts in the material realm, as the strange tale of the cart and the golden images vividly demonstrates.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark203" class="s27" name="bookmark225">3. </a><a href="#bookmark203" class="a">send it </a><span style=" color: #00F;">back</span><span class="p">.

Against the spareness and swift efficiency of </a>normal Hebrew narrative style, the writer here lavishes synonyms and repetitions in order to highlight the perfect geometry of the miracle: against all conceivable distractions of biology or sheer animal unknowingness, the cows pursue an arrow-straight northwest trajectory from Ekron to Beth-Shemesh.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark214" class="a" name="bookmark236">lowing as they </a>went<span class="p">. This small but vivid descriptive detail is an even more striking exception to the stringent economy that governs biblical narrative. The last thing one would expect in a biblical story, where there is scant report of the gestures of the human actors, is a specification of sounds made by draft animals. The point, however, is that the milch cows—more driven by the Ark than hauling it—are going strenuously against</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">nature: their udders full of milk for the calves they have been forced to leave behind, they mark with maternal lowing their distress over the journey they cannot resist. There is a peculiar resonance between this episode and Hannah’s story in Chapter 1. There, too, a nursing mother does not want to be separated from her young, and, as we noted, special emphasis is placed on the physical acts of nursing and weaning. (The connection between the two episodes is underscored in the Hebrew, which literally calls the cows’ young their “sons,” not their calves.) In both stories, sacrifice is offered after mother and young are separated. Here, of course, the mothers become the objects of the sacrifice; in Hannah’s story, it is a bull, and, in symbolic rather than literal fashion, the son as well. Though all these correspondences seem too pointed to be coincidental, it is unclear whether they represent the literary artifact of the redactor, or an allusion by the author of the Samuel story to the Ark Narrative.</p></li><li data-list-text="13."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark215" class="a" name="bookmark237">the men of Beth-Shemesh were </a>harvesting<span class="p">.

One connection between the Ark Narrative, with its concern for sanctity, and the Samuel-Saul-David cycle, with its preoccupation with politics, is a kind of brooding sense of the cruel price exacted for dedication to the higher cause. The milch cows are burned on the improvised altar; Hannah and her son Samuel must be separated in <i>his </i>dedication to the sanctuary; and later both Saul and David will pay terrible costs in their personal lives for their adhesion to power.</p></li></ol><ol id="l11"><li data-list-text="17."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark217" class="a" name="bookmark239">And these are the golden </a>tumors<span class="p">.

This appears to contradict the explicit directions in verse 4, that there should be exactly five golden mice.

This figure makes no sense because Beth-Shemesh was a small agricultural village. It appears in all the ancient versions, but Josephus seems to have possessed a text in which only the much more plausible number seventy appeared. The fact that the Hebrew has no indication of “and” between “seventy” and “fifty thousand” is further evidence that the latter number is an intrusion in the text.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark221" class="a" name="bookmark243">a great </a>blow<span class="p">.

This is half the formulaic figure of forty years that recurs so frequently in the Book of Judges. The period of twenty years could refer to the time until David brings the Ark up to Jerusalem, though given the immediate narrative context, the more likely reference is the time until Samuel assembles the tribes at Mizpah.

This phrase, and Samuel’s language here in general, is notably Deuteronomistic, and the narrative line in this chapter follows the Deuteronomistic theological assumption that cultic faithfulness leads to military success.

Compare, also, the end of Hannah’s poem: “the L<span class="s22">ORD </span>shatters His adversaries, / against them in the heavens He thunders.” Essentially, it is God Who does battle, with the Israelite foot soldiers merely mopping up after His celestial bombardment.

The Amorites—a designation often used loosely by the biblical writers for the indigenous Canaanite peoples—had also been dominated by the Philistine invaders, and Israel’s success against the Philistines may have been facilitated by an alliance, or at least a nonaggression pact, with the Amorites.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="15."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark262" class="a" name="bookmark280">And Samuel judged </a>Israel<span class="p">. The precise nature of his leadership is left ambiguous, as befits this transitional figure in Israel’s political evolution.

He is also judge in the sense of “chieftain” or political leader, though he plays this role not as a warrior, according to the model of the Book of Judges, but as exhorter and intercessor.

It is a signal expression of the ambiguity of Samuel’s role as leader that he oversteps his mandate as judge (<i>shofet—</i>both judicial authority and ad hoc political leader) by attempting to inaugurate a kind of dynastic arrangement. The two sons who betray their trust of office are a nice parallel to Eli’s two corrupt sons, who essentially were displaced by Samuel.</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark304">&zwnj;</a>judges in Beersheba<span class="p">.

Samuel is ideologically opposed to the monarchy because he is committed to the old idea of the ad hoc inspired leader, <i>shofet</i>, who is a kind of direct implementation of God’s rule through the divine spirit over the unique nation of Israel. God appears to agree with him but yields to political necessity. It is noteworthy that when the elders’ words are replayed in this verse from Samuel’s point of view, the very phrase rejecting covenantal status that must especially gall him, “like all the nations,” is suppressed.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark287" class="s27" name="bookmark307">8. </a><a href="#bookmark287" class="a">forsaking Me and serving other </a>gods<span class="p">. Both the locutions used and the preoccupation with cultic loyalty are notably Deuteronomistic, and the coupling of the shift in style with this theme leads one to suspect a seventh-century interpolation here, since there has been no question of idolatry in the immediate context. The elders’ expressed concern has been rather with the breakdown of the institution of the judge in Samuel’s corrupt sons. The grounds for the argument for and against monarchy will shift once again in Samuel’s speech (verses 11–18).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark288" class="s27" name="bookmark308">10. </a><a href="#bookmark288" class="a">asking of him a </a><span class="s20">king</span>. The Hebrew participle <i>sho’alim </i>takes us back to the verb of asking used in Samuel’s naming and points forward to <i>Sha’ul</i>, Saul.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark289" class="s27" name="bookmark309">11. </a><a href="#bookmark289" class="a">the practice of the </a><span class="s20">king</span>. This whole episode turns repeatedly on an untranslatable pun. <i>Mishpat </i>means “justice,” the very thing that Samuel’s sons have twisted by taking payoffs. <i>Mishpat </i>also means “habitual behavior,” “mode of operation,” or “practice.” As a verb the same root means either “to judge” or “to rule”: it is used (in a verbal noun) in the former sense in verses 1 and 2, in the latter sense in verses 5 and 6. The recurrent scholarly assumption that this whole attack on the encroachments of the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">monarchy reflects a knowledge of Solomon’s reign or of later Davidic kings is by no means inevitable: all the practices enumerated—military conscription, the corvée, expropriation of lands, taxation of the agricultural output—could easily have been familiar to an early writer from observing the Canaanite city-states or the larger imperial regimes to the east and the south.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark290" class="a" name="bookmark310">who will reign over </a><span class="s20">you</span>. The people had spoken of the king ruling/judging them (the verb <i>shafat</i>); Samuel unambiguously speaks of reigning (<i>malakh</i>, the cognate verb of <i>melekh</i>, king).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark311">&zwnj;</a><span class="s20">Your sons he will take</span>. Samuel’s speech is solidly constructed as a hammering piece of anti-monarchic rhetoric. All the cherished possessions to be expropriated by the king are placed emphatically at the beginning of each clause, followed by the verb of which they are objects. “He will take” (one word in the Hebrew, <i>yiqa</i><span class="s26">ḥ</span>) is insisted on with anaphoric force. The speech moves systematically from the expropriation of sons and daughters to land and produce to slaves and beasts of burden, ending with the climactic “you will become his slaves.” A modern American reader might easily be reminded of the rhetoric of a radical libertarian inveighing against the evils of big government and the encroachments of its bureaucracies and taxation. In no part of his pragmatic argument does Samuel mention the Deuteronomistic themes of abandoning the L<span class="s22">ORD </span>or betraying His direct kingship.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark292" class="s27" name="bookmark312">11.–12. </a><a href="#bookmark292" class="a">chariots . . . cavalry . . . </a>captains<span class="p">. The first item in the indictment of monarchy is military conscription. As is clear in the response of the people (verse 20), the consolidation of national military power under the king is precisely what attracts them to monarchy. All this leads one to suspect that the domination over the Philistines was by no means so comprehensive as claimed by the narrator in Chapter 7.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark293" class="s27" name="bookmark313">12. </a><a href="#bookmark293" class="a">to plow his ground and reap his </a>harvest<span class="p">.

After conscripting men to fight and men to perform agricultural service, the king will also draft the artisan class for his purpose— ironsmiths, carpenters, wheelwrights, and so forth.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark315">&zwnj;</a>his chariots<span class="p">. Samuel’s emphasis from the start on chariots signals the political shift he envisions, for chariots were the instruments of the monarchies with which Israel contended, whereas the Israelites in this early stage did not have this sort of military technology at their disposal, at least according to the Book of Judges.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark296" class="s27" name="bookmark316">14. </a><a href="#bookmark296" class="a">give to his </a>servants<span class="p">. “Servants” in a royal context would be the functionaries of the royal bureaucracy, whose service to the king was in fact often rewarded by land grants.</span></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark297" class="s27" name="bookmark317">16. </a><a href="#bookmark297" class="a">your </a><span style=" color: #00F;">cattle</span><span class="p">.

This phrase reflects a specific military idiom—the full version of it is, literally, “to go out and come in before us,” that is, to lead in battle, to execute maneuvers. The military power that can accrue to the nation through the king is what is uppermost in the minds of the people.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark302" class="s27" name="bookmark322">22. </a><a href="#bookmark302" class="a">Go every man to his </a>town<span class="p">. Though God has just instructed Samuel to comply with the people’s demand for a monarchy, Samuel’s immediate response instead is to send them back to their homes.

And they came down from the high place into the town, and </a><a href="#bookmark377" class="s12">they made a bed for Saul </a><a href="#bookmark378" class="s12">on </a><a href="#bookmark377" class="s12">the roof</a><a href="#bookmark377" class="s11">, and he slept. And as dawn was breaking, Samuel </a><a href="#bookmark379" class="s11">called out to Saul on the roof, saying, “Arise and I shall send you off.” And Saul arose, and the two of them, he and Samuel, went outside.

According to the general principle of biblical narrative that the first reported speech of a character is a defining moment of characterization, Saul’s first utterance reveals him as a young man uncertain about pursuing his way, and quite concerned about his father. This concern, especially in light of the attention devoted to tense relations between fathers and sons in the ensuing narrative, is touching, and suggests that the young Saul is a sensitive person—an attribute that will be woefully submerged by his experience of political power. But as this first dialogue unfolds, it is Saul’s uncertainty that comes to the fore because at every step he has to be prodded and directed by his own servant.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="6."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark328" class="a" name="bookmark356">there is a man of God in this town . . . whatever he says will surely come to </a>pass<span class="p">. The fact that neither Saul nor his servant seems to have heard of Samuel by name (and the town, too, is left unnamed) has led many scholars to conclude that this story comes from a different source. But, as Robert Polzin has vigorously argued, the palpable shift between Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 may rather reflect “the varying play of perspectives (between narrator and reader, between reader and character, and between character and character) that forms the stuff of sophisticated narrative.” Saul’s entire story, until the night before his death on the battlefield, is a story about the futile quest for knowledge of an inveterately ignorant man. Samuel may have been presented before as the spiritual leader of all the tribes, but this particular Benjaminite farm boy knows nothing of him, and Saul’s servant, who presumably has also spent all his time on the farm, has picked up merely a local rumor of his activity but not his name. From the rural-popular perspective of both, and in keeping with the themes of knowledge and prediction of this story, Samuel is not a judge and political leader but a “man of God” and a “seer” (compare verse 9) who can predict the future.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark329" class="a" name="bookmark357">he will tell us of our way on which we have </a><span class="s20">gone</span>. The Hebrew verb clearly indicates some sort of past action and not, as one might expect, <i>“</i>on which we should go.” Perhaps they feel so lost that they need the seer to tell them where they have been heading. In the event, it is toward a kingdom, not toward lost asses.</p></li><li data-list-text="7."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark330" class="a" name="bookmark358">But look, if we are to go, what shall we </a>bring. <span class="p">The diffident Saul is on the point of quitting before the encounter.

This terminological notice simultaneously alerts the audience to the gap between the time of the story (the eleventh century BCE) and the audience’s own time (at the very least, two or three generations later) and underscores the ambiguity of Samuel’s transitional role as leader: he is variously called judge, man of God, seer, and prophet, and he also performs priestly functions.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark361">&zwnj;</a>to inquire of God<span class="p">.

The wells would have typically been outside the walls of the city. The encounter between a young man in foreign territory with young women (<i>ne‘arot</i>) drawing water seems to signal the beginning of a betrothal type-scene (compare Rebekah, Rachel, and Zipporah at their respective wells). But the betrothal scene is aborted. Instead of a betrothal feast, there will be a sacrificial feast that adumbrates a rite of coronation. The destiny of kingship to which Saul proceeds will lead to grimmer consequences than those that follow in the repeated story of a hero who finds this future bride at a well.</p></li><li data-list-text="12."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark336" class="s27" name="bookmark364">–13. </a><a href="#bookmark336" class="s24">The reply of the young </a><span style=" color: #00F;">women </span>is notable for its garrulousness. One talmudic sage sought to explain this trait with a simple misogynistic formula: “women are talkative” (<i>Berakhot </i>48 b), whereas, more amusingly, the Midrash proposes that the young women kept repeating themselves because they were so smitten by Saul’s beauty. The clues in the immediately preceding narrative context suggest a less fanciful explanation: seeing the evident signs of confusion and incomprehension in Saul’s face, the women take elaborate measures to spell out where Samuel is to be found and what Saul should do in order to be sure not to miss him. In all this, it is noteworthy, as Polzin has observed, that Samuel, having agreed to find a king for Israel, has made no move whatever toward that purpose. Instead, the future king “finds” him.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark337" class="a" name="bookmark365">the high </a><span class="s20">place</span>. The <i>bamah </i>was an elevated place, a kind of open-air natural altar, perhaps sometimes with a structure erected alongside it (see the “hall” in verse 22), where sacrifices were generally offered in the period before the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. The kind of sacrifice involved here is one in which parts of the animal would be burned on the altar and the rest eaten in a ceremonial feast.</p><ol id="l20"><li data-list-text="16."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark366">&zwnj;</a><span class="s20">prince</span>. The Hebrew <i>nagid </i>is not used to refer to leaders before this moment in Israelite history and is used only rarely after the very early years of the monarchy. It is a term that suggests the exercise of political power in a designated role of leadership rather than in the manner of the ad hoc charismatic leadership of the <i>shofet</i>, or judge. But God, in keeping with this transitional moment and perhaps even in deference to Samuel’s keen resentment of the monarchy, pointedly does not use the word “king.”</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark339" class="a" name="bookmark367">he shall rescue My </a>people<span class="p">.

The phrase “as I said to the people” is no more than an interpretive guess about an asyntactic chain of three words in the Hebrew, which literally are “saying the-people I-invited.</p></li><li data-list-text="25."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark377">&zwnj;</a>they made a bed for Saul on the roof, and he slept<span class="p">.

Evidently, a scribe substituted the common word <i>wayidaber</i>, “he spoke,” for the more unusual word <i>wayirbedu</i>, “they made a bed” (the same consonants with the order reversed). <i>Wayishkav</i>, “and he slept,” differs from <i>wayashkimu</i>, “and they rose early,” by one consonant in the unvocalized text.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark349" class="a" name="bookmark378">the </a>roof<span class="p">.

Every step that Samuel takes here in conferring the kingship on Saul is clandestine. He speaks to him only after they have reached the outskirts of the town, and he is sure first to get Saul’s servant out of earshot. This course of action is rather puzzling because the people, after all, have already publicly declared to the prophet that they want him to choose a king for them. Samuel’s need to proceed in secrecy may reflect his persistent sense that the monarchy is the wrong path for the people, or it might be an expression of doubt as to whether this strapping young Benjaminite is really the right man for the job, despite the unambiguous indication that the prophet has just received from God.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">CHAPTER 10</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark380">&zwnj;</a><span class="s3">A</span><a href="#bookmark414" class="s6">nd </a><a href="#bookmark414" class="s5">Samuel took the </a>cruse <span style=" color: #000;">of oil and poured it over his head and kissed him, and he said, “Has not the L</span><span class="s8">ORD </span><a href="#bookmark415" class="s6">anointed you over His inheritance as prince? </a><a href="#bookmark415" class="s5">When you go away from me </a>today <a href="#bookmark416" class="s6">you shall find two men by </a><a href="#bookmark416" class="s5">Rachel’s </a>Tomb <a href="#bookmark417" class="s6">in the region of Benjamin </a><a href="#bookmark417" class="s5">at </a>Zelzah<a href="#bookmark418" class="s6">, and they will say to you, ‘The asses that you went off to seek have been found, and, look, </a><a href="#bookmark418" class="s5">your father has put aside the matter of the asses and is worrying about you</a><a href="#bookmark418" class="s6">, saying, What shall I do </a><a href="#bookmark420" class="s6">about my son?’ And you </a><a href="#bookmark419" class="s6">shall </a><a href="#bookmark419" class="s5">slip </a><a href="#bookmark420" class="s5">onward </a><a href="#bookmark420" class="s6">from there and you shall come to </a><a href="#bookmark421" class="s5">the </a><a href="#bookmark420" class="s5">Terebinth of Tabor</a><a href="#bookmark420" class="s6">, and there </a><a href="#bookmark420" class="s5">three men will find you who are going up </a><a href="#bookmark421" class="s5">to God at Bethel, one bearing three kids and one bearing three loaves of </a>bread <a href="#bookmark422" class="s6">and one bearing a jug of wine.

According to the fixed procedure of verbal recycling in biblical narrative, the predicted words of the two men are nearly identical with Saul’s first words to his servant. One should note that in the scenario Samuel lays out for him, Saul has no opportunity to respond to his father’s concern for his absence: on the contrary, his new regal obligations rush him onward toward a daunting rite of initiation.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark385" class="a" name="bookmark419">slip </a><span class="s20">onward</span>.

The triple three is a folktale pattern. It also manifests a mysterious design clearly grasped by Samuel, who annunciates this whole prediction, and into which Saul is thrust unwitting. The three men bear meat (or animals that can be turned into meat), bread, and wine—the three symbolic staffs of life. They will offer Saul the primary of the three, bread (in counterpoint to the “worthless fellows” at the end of the episode who give the new king no tribute).</span></p><ol id="l23"><li data-list-text="5."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark422">&zwnj;</a>Gibeath-Elohim<span class="p">. The name means Hill of God, but it would seem to be the same as the Gibeah of Judges 19, in which the Benjaminites perpetrate a lethal gang rape, and is also known as Gibeath-Benjamin and Gibeath-Saul.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark389" class="a" name="bookmark423">the Philistine </a>prefect<span class="p">. This glancing reference to a Philistine garrison deep within Benjaminite territory is still another indication of the Philistines’ military ascendancy. That might be another reason for keeping the anointment secret, at least until the new king can consolidate military force around him. The Masoretic text has a plural “prefects,” but three different ancient translations reflect a singular.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark390" class="a" name="bookmark424">a band of </a>prophets<span class="p">. These are professional ecstatics who would whip themselves into a  frenzy  with  the  insistent  rhythms  of  the  musical  instruments  mentioned—a phenomenon familiar in enthusiastic religious sects worldwide—and then would “prophesy,” become caught up in ecstatic behavior, which could involve glossolalia (“speaking in tongues”), dancing, writhing, and the like. The chief connection between these figures and the later literary prophets is the idea that both are involuntarily inhabited by an overpowering divine spirit.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark425">&zwnj;</a><span class="s20">lute</span>. The Hebrew word for this instrument, <i>nevel</i>, is identical with the word for “jug” used at the end of verse 3 (the homonymity may be explained by a perceived lyre shape in the jug). It is a fairly common procedure in biblical narrative to link segments in immediate sequence by using this sort of pun as a linchpin. Here it has the effect of intimating an uncanny link between the first and second stages of the script Samuel is designing for Saul.</p></li><li data-list-text="6."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark392" class="a" name="bookmark426">you shall turn into another </a>man<span class="p">. The drastic nature of this process is surely meant by Samuel to be startling: nothing less will do in order to transform this diffident farmer’s son into a king than to be devastated by the divine spirit, violently compelled to radical metamorphosis. This whole story of Saul among the prophets is repeated, with very significant changes, in Chapter 19, near the end of his tortuous career. As we shall have occasion to see, the seeming repetition, far from being a regrettable “doublet” produced in redaction, is entirely purposeful: the same etiological tale is rotated 180 degrees to show us first Saul being invested with the spirit, and with the monarchy, and then divested of the monarchy by the spirit.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="7."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark427">&zwnj;</a>do what your hand finds<span class="p">.

Seven days shall you </a>wait<span class="p">. The third stage in the set of predictions/instructions that Samuel announces to Saul is in fact not carried out till much later. Saul’s divergence from the prophet’s script adumbrates his future failures of obedience in relation to Samuel. Robert Polzin has made the shrewd argument that the unfulfilled prediction also reflects Samuel’s failure as a prophet, and that he has actually placed Saul in a double bind by telling him that he may do whatever he wants because God is with him and yet “has paradoxically commanded strict royal dependence upon prophetic direction.” Samuel, in other words, seems to want both a king and a puppet.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="9."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark395" class="a" name="bookmark429">as he turned his </a><span class="s20">back</span>. The Hebrew <i>shekhem </i>is also the word for “shoulder,” and so reminds us of Saul’s regal stature, head and shoulders above all the people.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark396" class="a" name="bookmark430">God gave him another heart and all these signs came to </a>pass<span class="p">.

There is no report of the first of Samuel’s predicted encounters, with the three men bearing kids, bread, and wine. It is unclear whether this reflects merely a narrative ellipsis or whether this, too, is an unfulfilled prophecy. The report of the meeting with the two men who announce that the asses have been found is also omitted. In any case, the transformative meeting with the band of ecstatics is obviously the chief focus of the writer’s attention.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark398" class="a" name="bookmark432">the spirit of the L</a><a href="#bookmark398" class="s21">ORD </a><a href="#bookmark398" class="a">seized </a>him<span class="p">. This same phrase, or a slight variant of it, is repeatedly used in the Book of Judges to indicate the inception of the judge’s enterprise as charismatic military leader. There is some overlap with Saul’s taking on the kingship, which will also involve military leadership, but the report of ecstasy or “prophesying” is a new element, with its more radical implication that the new leader must become “another man.”</span></p></li><li data-list-text="11."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark399" class="a" name="bookmark433">Is Saul, too, among the </a>prophets? <span class="p">This evidently proverbial question, its full origins scarcely remembered, is the perplexity that generates the etiological tale. The question seems to be proverbial of a case of extreme incongruity (like the English “bull in a</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">china shop”)—what on earth is a man like Saul doing among the prophets? The tale then comes to explain how the saying arose. But the etiological tale, together with its antithetical counterpart in Chapter 19, figures significantly in the literary design of the Saul story. Even the characterizing theme of Saul’s repeated exclusion from predictive knowledge is inscribed in the question, “Is Saul, too, among the prophets?” The people ask their question about Saul in a line of poetry (consisting of two parallel versets). The verse form explains why Saul is first referred to as “son of Kish” because in poetry based on parallelism, it is the fixed procedure for treating proper names to use the given name in one verset and, in lieu of a synonym, the patronymic in the other. Thus, the claim made by some scholars that “son of Kish” is derogatory has no basis.</p></li><li data-list-text="12."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark400" class="a" name="bookmark434">who is their </a>father? <span class="p">The reference is obscure. The least convoluted explanation makes the prophets the antecedent of “their.” The meaning then would be that unlike Saul, whose father is Kish, a landholder and a man of substance, the ecstatics are a breed apart, with no father anyone can name (the leader of a band of prophets was called idiomatically their father). The prevalent attitude toward such prophets was ambivalent: they were at once viewed as vehicles of a powerful and dangerous divine spirit, and as crazies (compare Hosea 9:7).</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark401" class="s27" name="bookmark435">14. </a><a href="#bookmark401" class="a">Saul’s </a>uncle<span class="p">. The appearance, without introduction, of an uncle (and not Saul’s father, who after his brief initial appearance is never brought into the narrative proper) is puzzling.

This national assembly is the second of three episodes that inaugurate Saul’s kingship. One should not leap too quickly to the conclusion that these are merely a stitching together of variant sources. From the writer’s viewpoint, the institution of the monarchy, with Saul as first king, is both a difficult and a dubious process, and it cannot happen all at once. First there is the clandestine anointment, followed by an initiatory experience, under the nose of the Philistine prefect. Then there is a public proclamation of the king, at which time sufficient forces can be marshaled to bolster him against the Philistines.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="18."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark404" class="a" name="bookmark438">Thus said the L</a><a href="#bookmark404" class="s21">ORD </a><a href="#bookmark404" class="a">God of </a>Israel<span class="p">. Samuel begins his speech with the so-called messenger formula, which is used to initiate prophetic messages. His speech is in fact a kind of prophetic denunciation of the people for having “cast aside” God in demanding a king and so is a reprise of his antimonarchic harangue in Chapter 8, even as he implements the choice of a king.</span></p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark405" class="s27" name="bookmark439">20. </a><a href="#bookmark405" class="a">the lot </a><span class="s20">fell</span>.

Perhaps especially because Saul has been hauled out from the midst of saddle packs and sundry impedimenta, Samuel now executes a gesture of public relations: look at this strapping, handsome fellow—there is none in Israel who can match him. In the event, he proves wrong about Saul’s fitness for the throne, and one may even wonder whether Samuel’s proclamation that this is the one God has chosen (confirmed by the narrator’s previous report) is not a misperception to justify his own (erring) choice.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark409" class="a" name="bookmark443">Long live the </a><span class="s20">king</span>.

And the people said to Saul, “Whoever said, ‘</a><a href="#bookmark473" class="s5">Saul shall not be king over </a>us<a href="#bookmark474" class="s6">,’ give us these men and we shall put them to death.” And Saul said, “</a><a href="#bookmark474" class="s5">No man shall be put to death this day</a><a href="#bookmark474" class="s6">, for today the L</a><a href="#bookmark474" class="s7">ORD </a><a href="#bookmark474" class="s6">has wrought victory in Israel.” </a><a href="#bookmark475" class="s6">And Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal and </a><a href="#bookmark475" class="s5">we shall renew there the kingship</a><a href="#bookmark475" class="s6">.” And all the people went to Gilgal and they made Saul</a><a name="bookmark449">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark450">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark451">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark452">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark453">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark454">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark455">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark456">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark457">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark458">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark459">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark460">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark461">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">king there before the L<span class="s13">ORD  </span>at Gilgal, and they sacrificed their well-being sacrifices before the L<span class="s13">ORD</span>, and Saul rejoiced there, and all the men of Israel with him, very greatly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 3pt;text-align: left;"/><ol id="l26"><li data-list-text="1."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark448" class="a" name="bookmark462">Nahash the </a>Ammonite<span class="p">. During this period, the Ammonite kingdom, in the region to the east of the Jordan, was the second great military threat to the Israelites, after the Philistines to the west. David would later besiege the Ammonite capital, Rabbath Ammon (near the site of present-day Amman). This episode, marking the inception of Saul’s military activity, has several details that will be echoed later in the David story.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark463">&zwnj;</a>Jabesh-Gilead<span class="p">. This Israelite settlement, in the tribal territory of Manasseh, was located several miles east of the Jordan and hence was exposed to Ammonite attack. In the story of the concubine at Gibeah—Saul’s hometown—the men of Jabesh-Gilead refuse to fight in the civil war against Benjamin, and so some special kinship between them and Saul’s tribe is inferable. The Samuel scroll found in Cave 4 at Qumran reports a general campaign by Nahash against the trans-Jordanian Israelites. Here are the verses from the Qumran version (brackets indicate reconstructed letters or words, where there are gaps in the scroll): “[and Na]hash king of the Ammonites oppressed the Gadites and the Reubenites mightily and gouged out the right eye of e[very] one of them and imposed fe[ar and terror] on [I]srael, and there remained not a man of the Israelites be[yond] the Jordan [who]se right eye Nah[ash king of] the Ammonites did n[ot] [gou]ge out. Only seven thousand men [fled from] the Ammonites and came to [J]abesh-Gilead. And after about a month”—the words that follow are identical with verse 1 in the Masoretic text.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark464">&zwnj;</a><span style=" color: #00F;">the gouging out of the right eye</span><span class="p">. Mutilation of captives was a fairly common practice. Josephus explains that the blinding of the right eye would have impaired the ability to fight because the left eye was largely covered by the shield in battle. In any case, submitting to this ghastly mutilation was a mark of great humiliation, or “disgrace” </span>(<span class="s26">ḥ</span>erpah)<span class="p">.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark451" class="a" name="bookmark465">Leave us alone for seven </a>days<span class="p">. Nahash’s seemingly surprising agreement to this condition is by no means a sign of generosity but must be understood from his viewpoint as an additional opportunity to humiliate the Israelites: he scarcely imagines that the disunited tribes will produce a “rescuer,” and thus the impotent tribes will all be forced to witness helplessly the mutilation of their trans-Jordanian kinsmen.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark452" class="a" name="bookmark466">the messengers came to </a>Gibeath-Saul<span class="p">. The men of Jabesh-Gilead have told Nahash they would search through “all the territory of Israel.” But perhaps they know something he does not—that Israel already has a tribally acclaimed ruler and military leader who resides in Gibeah, but who has not yet begun to act. The scholarly assumption that this entire story blatantly contradicts the previous account of Saul’s election as king and hence must derive from an independent source is by no means necessary.</span></p></li></ol><ol id="l27"><li data-list-text="6."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark453" class="a" name="bookmark467">the spirit of God seized </a>Saul<span class="p">. As many commentators have noted, the story here explicitly follows the model of the inception of the charismatic leader’s career in Judges, when a kind of berserker spirit enters him and ignites him with eagerness to do battle. Saul’s coming in from the field behind the oxen is also reminiscent of the pattern in Judges in which an agriculturalist (compare Gideon) is transformed by an access of the spirit into a warrior. Given the uncertainty about the new monarchic dispensation, it is quite possible that Saul, after having been proclaimed king at Mizpah, might have returned to his work in the field, awaiting the occasion when he would begin to act on his new royal authority. The archetypal tale of the farmer who steps forward to save the nation in time of crisis will recur in Roman tradition in the story of Cincinnatus at the plow.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="7."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark454" class="a" name="bookmark468">he took a yoke of oxen and hacked them to </a>pieces<span class="p">. This violent symbolism doubly distinguishes Saul from the model of the ad hoc warrior-leader in Judges. The dismemberment of the oxen is an explicit repetition of the dismemberment of the concubine at the end of Judges 19 after she has been gang raped to death by the men of Gibeah (later the home of Saul). In Judges, too, the bloody members were used to assemble all the tribes of Israel to war, though the person who hacked the body to pieces was not a judge but rather the morally dubious Levite, husband of the dead woman. The allusion here is exquisitely ambiguous. Is this an act of restitution, a setting right of the ghastly civil war caused by the atrocity at Gibeah, or does it inaugurate the narrative of Saul’s public actions under the shadow of an earlier act of turpitude? Saul also differs from the judges in behaving like a king, for he prepares for war by instituting a kind of military conscription binding on all the tribes (the judges depended on volunteers and worked locally). Kings, like mafia capos, operate through coercion: Saul, in sending the hacked-up oxen parts to his fellow Israelites with the threat, “Whoever does not come out . . . thus will be done to his oxen,” is presenting them with an offer they cannot refuse.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark455" class="a" name="bookmark469">after Saul and after </a>Samuel<span class="p">. The medieval Hebrew commentator Kimchi offers a shrewd explanation for Saul’s adding Samuel to his exhortation. “Since not all of them had accepted him as king, he said ‘after Samuel.’”</span></p><p class="s32" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark456" class="a" name="bookmark470">the fear of the L</a>ORD<span class="p">.

The “not” appears in some variant manuscripts. The Masoretic text as it stands is usually construed as a question: “Saul will be king over us?” Robert Polzin tries to save the simple declarative sense of the Masoretic text by proposing that after Saul has just powerfully acted like one of the old-time judges, the people, with the implicit endorsement of Saul, are inclined to retract their own insistence on monarchy and return to the institution of judgeship. This reading is ingenious, but may create more problems than it solves. The report of continuing dissidence about Saul’s claim to the throne, as at the end of the previous chapter, in fact sets the stage for much that will follow.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="13."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark460" class="a" name="bookmark474">No man shall be put to death this </a>day<span class="p">.

This clause helps make sense of the triple story of Saul’s dedication as king. First there was the clandestine anointment, with no publicly visible consequences. Then there was the tribal assembly at Mizpah in which a reluctant Saul was chosen by lot and proclaimed king. After that event, however, he appears to have returned for the time being to private life. Now, following his signal success in mustering the tribes and defeating Ammon, Samuel calls for a new assembly to reconfirm Saul’s standing as king, which will then be seen in subsequent episodes manifested in the institutions and power of a regular court.</span></p></li></ol><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">CHAPTER 12</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark497" class="s28" name="bookmark476">A</a><a href="#bookmark497" class="s5">nd Samuel said to all </a><span style=" color: #00F;">Israel</span><a href="#bookmark498" class="s6">, “Look, </a><a href="#bookmark498" class="s5">I have heeded your </a><span style=" color: #00F;">voice </span><a href="#bookmark499" class="s6">in all that you said to me and have set a king over you.

Samuel’s speech seems to be an intertwining of an early story with a Deuteronomistic (seventh- century or sixth-century) editorial recasting. The vehement opposition to the monarchy would be original, perhaps even going back to the historical figure of Samuel. The Deuteronomistic school on its part was by no means anti-monarchic, though it wanted to limit the monarch with the rules of the Book of God’s Teaching (the Torah). On the other hand, the sin of idolatry is not an issue in the Samuel story, but it is a Deuteronomistic preoccupation. It is at this point in the speech that we encounter clusters of Deuteronomistic verbal formulas: “abandoned the L<span class="s22">ORD </span>and served the Baalim,” “delivered [literally, sold] into the hand of,” “fear the L<span class="s22">ORD </span>and serve Him and heed His voice,” “serve Him truly with all your heart.”</p></li><li data-list-text="11."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark507">&zwnj;</a>Bedan<span class="p">.

Since there had been no question of Nahash in the original demand for a king in Chapter 8, many scholars have inferred that the present episode reflects a different tradition, in which the call for monarchy is specifically linked with the Ammonite incursion reported in Chapter 11. But Moshe Garsiel proposes an interesting political reading that preserves the unity of the text. The original</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">request for a king stresses the need for a military leader but mentions no particular enemy, perhaps because the people fear to name the dominant Philistines. Saul would have initially been installed in the ceremony at Mizpah as a sort of vassal king (or, alternatively, leader of an underground movement), for the Philistines had garrisons in the territory of Benjamin. Now, after Saul’s military success against the Ammonites, Samuel explicitly associates the call for a monarchy with Nahash’s assault on Israel. This meeting at Gilgal would also have been an occasion to enlist the allegiance to Saul of the trans-Jordanian tribes.</p></li><li data-list-text="13."><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark489" class="a" name="bookmark510">the king you have chosen, for whom you have </a><span style=" color: #00F;">asked</span><span class="p">. Several times Samuel plays sardonically on “asked” (</span>sha’al<span class="p">) and “Saul” (</span>Sha’ul<span class="p">). Moshe Garsiel also suggests a pun as well in “chosen” (</span>ba<span class="s26">ḥ</span>ar<span class="p">) and the introductory designation of Saul as a “fine fellow” (</span>ba<span class="s26">ḥ</span>ur<span class="p">, literally “chosen one”). Although the story of the institution of the monarchy indicates that God does the choosing, there is no real contradiction—Samuel, in his acute discomfort with the monarchy that has displaced his own authority, readily imputes the choosing to the people, despite his awareness that God has supposedly chosen. God on His part no more than acquiesces in the people’s stubborn insistence on a king. The ambiguity of Saul’s divine election will continue to be manifested in the narrative.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="14."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark490" class="a" name="bookmark511">rebel not against the L</a><a href="#bookmark490" class="s21">ORD</a><a href="#bookmark490" class="a">’</a><a href="#bookmark490" class="s21">S </a><span class="s20">words</span>.

The entire story of Samuel’s fixing a period of seven days for Saul to await him at Gilgal before the offering of sacrifices goes back to 10:8. The fulfillment of that initial instruction to the new king has been interrupted by the election of Saul by lottery, his campaign against the Ammonites, and the renewal of the kingship at Gilgal. One must assume either that the order to await Samuel at Gilgal was for an eventual meeting at an unspecified future time or that one literary strand of the Saul story has been interrupted by the splicing in of other strands (Chapters 11–12).</p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark529" class="a" name="bookmark555">the troops began to slip away from </a>him<span class="p">.

The Masoretic text has a declarative, “you have not kept,” but the structure of the whole sentence argues strongly for emending <i>lo</i>’ (“not”) to <i>lu </i>(“if” introducing a clause contrary to fact).

The Masoretic text, both in this clause and the next, has “Ark of God” instead of “ephod,” but the reading of the Septuagint, <i>ephod</i>, is compelling on several grounds. We have been informed earlier that the Ark of God was left, not to be moved for the foreseeable future, at Kiriath-Jearim. The Ark was not an instrument of divination, like the ephod, and what Saul wants Ahijah to do here is to divine. It is possible that Ahijah’s lineal connection with the keepers of the Ark at Shiloh led some early transmitter of the text to align this episode with the earlier story in which the Ark</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">—quite misguidedly—was brought out from Shiloh to the battlefield. The Masoretic text also reads, asyntactically, “for the Ark of God on that day was, and the Israelites,” whereas the Septuagint, far more coherently, has “for on that day he was bearing the ephod before the Israelites.”</p></li><li data-list-text="19."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark628">&zwnj;</a>Pull back your hand<span class="p">.

This spectacle of total, self- mutilating panic (<i>mehumah</i>)in the camp of the enemy is a recurrent motif that goes back to Judges (compare the effect of Gideon’s surprise attack on the Midianite camp), and is a kind of narrative realization of God’s direct intervention in battle to grant victory to Israel. The foundational instance of this motif is the victory at the Sea of Reeds in Exodus.</p></li><li data-list-text="21."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark589" class="a" name="bookmark630">Hebrews who were previously with the </a>Philistines<span class="p">. Given the subject status of the Israelites, it is not surprising that some of them would have been conscripted by the Philistines, either as soldiers or to perform menial tasks for the troops. They are referred to here as “Hebrews” because that is how their Philistine masters would have referred to them.</span></p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark590" class="s27" name="bookmark631">24. </a><a href="#bookmark590" class="a">And the men of Israel were hard </a><span class="s20">pressed</span>. The explanation for being hard pressed is not certain. The Hebrew term, <i>nigas</i>, most naturally refers to being at a military disadvantage, but here the Israelites appear to have the upper hand. The other possibility is that the men are weak from hunger, not having had the opportunity to eat in their hot pursuit of the Philistines. The oath Saul exacts would then compound this predicament. It should be said that the Septuagint reflects a different text for this entire clause: “And Saul committed a great blunder on that day.”</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark591" class="a" name="bookmark632">Cursed be the man who eats </a>food<span class="p">. As we shall have occasion to see later in the David narrative, it was a fairly common practice (though by no means an automatic one) for fighting men to take on themselves a vow of abstinence from food, in order to enter the battle in what amounted to a state of dedicated ritual purity. But Saul in this instance makes a miscalculation, imposing a fast on hungry men, in an effort to force the hand of divinity. (Thus the Septuagint’s version of the first clause of this verse might be regarded as an interpretive gloss on the lapidary formulation of the received text.)</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark592" class="s27" name="bookmark633">25. </a><a href="#bookmark592" class="a">And the whole country came into the </a><span class="s20">forest</span>. This sounds as odd in the Hebrew as in translation because “country” (<i>ha’arets</i>)  is  not  an  idiomatic  term  for  “people.” Extensive textual surgery yields this conjectural reconstruction of an original clause: “and there was honeycomb on the ground.” An additional difficulty in this passage is that the common Hebrew term <i>ya‘ar</i>, forest, has a rare homonym that means honeycomb. (In verse 27, the term that occurs is <i>ya‘arah</i>, which is unambiguous both because with the feminine suffix it can refer only to honeycomb and because it is joined with <i>devash</i>, honey.) But the received text in our verse has the preposition “into” (<i>b</i><i>e</i>), which presumes that <i>ya‘ar </i>means “forest” and not “honeycomb.”</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark593" class="s27" name="bookmark634">27. </a><span class="s20">his eyes lit up</span>. The idiom used for the refreshing effect of a taste of food is a pointed one because, as Shimon Bar-Efrat has noted, the verb “to light up” (the Hebrew verb ’<i>or</i>) plays antithetically on Saul’s “cursed (’<i>arur</i>) be the man.”</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark594" class="s27" name="bookmark635">29. </a><a href="#bookmark594" class="a">My father has stirred up </a><span class="s20">trouble</span>. The verb ‘<i>akhar </i>that is used here is doubly important. Etymologically, it means “to muddy,” as in stirring up muck in a pond. Thus, it is an antithesis to the lighting up of the eyes Jonathan has just experienced through partaking of food. It is also the verb Jephthah invokes when he sees it is his daughter who has come out to greet him: “and you have been among those who stir up trouble for me” (Judges 11:35). The echo sets up a network of intertextual links with the Jephthah story: here, too, a father who is a military leader seeks to influence the outcome of the battle by a rash vow that is an unwitting death sentence on his own child.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark595" class="s27" name="bookmark636">31. </a><a href="#bookmark595" class="a">And they struck down the </a>Philistines<span class="p">. Although the form of the two verbs does not indicate it, the narrative logic of the scene compels us to construe this sentence as a pluperfect summary of the day’s action, responding to Jonathan’s reference to the “toll” (literally, “blow”) exacted from the Philistines.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark596" class="s27" name="bookmark637">32. </a><a href="#bookmark596" class="a">the troops pounced on the booty . . . ate them together with the </a>blood<span class="p">. The first verb here has pejorative force, being generally used for birds of prey descending on their victims. Biblical law repeatedly prohibits the consumption of meat together with the blood because the blood is regarded as the sacred stuff of life. The slaughtering on the ground here would make it more difficult to allow the blood to drain off, as would have been done in slaughtering on a stone platform or altar. (Note Saul’s correction of the practice in verses 33–34.) Jonathan’s tasting a bit of honey thus leads to an orgy of gluttonous consumption of meat with blood. This consequence attaches an association of violation of sacred law to Jonathan’s act, but the ultimate fault lies with Saul, who by imposing a fast on already famished men has set them up to abandon all restraint the moment the taboo against eating is broken.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark597" class="s27" name="bookmark638">34. </a><a href="#bookmark597" class="a">what he had in </a><span class="s20">hand</span>.

Although it was extremely common for military leaders everywhere in the ancient Near East to consult an oracle before going into battle, Saul’s failed inquiry here participates in a larger pattern in his story: he is constantly seeking knowledge of what is about to happen (as in his quest for a seer to help him locate the asses at the very beginning), but this knowledge is repeatedly withheld from him.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="38."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark599" class="a" name="bookmark640">wherein is this </a>offense<span class="p">.

Jonathan now is brought forth as the possible perpetrator of some further, not yet specified offense, which will prove to be the tasting of the honey. In any case, there seems to be some deep ambivalence between father and son well before the appearance of David at court.</p><ol id="l41"><li data-list-text="41."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark601" class="a" name="bookmark642">L</a><a href="#bookmark601" class="s21">ORD</a><a href="#bookmark601" class="a">, God of Israel!

This version comes from the Septuagint. The Masoretic text here has </a>the short and cryptic “Show Thammim [sic].” Saul’s frustrated reference to his failure to receive an answer from the oracle makes a great deal of narrative sense (see the comment on verse 37). The Septuagint version also makes intelligible the process of oracular lottery. The Urim and Thummim were two divinatory objects attached to the ephod, probably in a special compartment. They may have been in the form of stones or tokens with lettering on them. They provided indication of binary oppositions: thus the question addressed to the oracle had to take the form of yes or no, x or y. The opposition may have been underscored by the fact that Urim and Thummim begin, respectively, with the first and last letter of the Hebrew alphabet. More speculatively, Urim might be linked with ’<i>aror</i>, “to curse,” and Thummim with the root <i>t-m-m</i>, whole or innocent.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark602" class="a" name="bookmark643">the lot fell on Jonathan and </a>Saul<span class="p">.

The verb used, <i>lakad</i>, is the same one just invoked for the process of being caught, trapped, taken hold of, in the divine lottery. Saul himself was “caught” for kingship. Now, through conquest, he catches, or secures, the kingship. There is thus surely an undertone of ambiguity in this report of his success as monarch.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark607" class="a" name="bookmark648">he would inflict </a><span class="s20">punishment</span>. The Hebrew <i>yarshi‘a </i>usually means to condemn someone as guilty in a court of justice. But a related idiom, “to do justice,” ‘<i>asot shephatim</i>, also means to carry out punitive acts against an enemy. The Masoretic version is to be preferred to the Septuagint’s <i>yoshi‘a</i>, “he would rescue,” because in this narrative, God, not Saul, is represented as the rescuer. Apparently, the implication is that he carried out punishing expeditions against Israel’s enemies to the east of the Jordan without actually conquering them, as David was to do.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark608" class="s27" name="bookmark649">49. </a><a href="#bookmark608" class="a">And Saul’s </a>sons<span class="p">.

The episode in which Saul pronounces a death sentence on his son and heir heralds the climactic encounter with Samuel over Amalek in which the prophet will pronounce the end of Saul’s incipient dynasty.

Samuel, by placing the accusative first-person pronoun at the beginning of his speech (normal Hebrew usage would simply attach an accusative suffix to the verb), once again highlights his own centrality to this whole process: it is only because he, as God’s unique delegate, has anointed Saul that Saul can claim to be king.

The verb here is in the plural, evidently including the troops together with Saul, though the subsequent verbs in this verse are in the singular. The “ban” (<span class="s26">ḥ</span><i>erem</i>), one of the cruelest practices of ancient Near Eastern warfare, is an injunction of total destruction—of all living things—of the enemy. Amalek is, of course, the archetypal implacable enemy of Israel, but it should be said that here, as throughout the Samuel story, there is at least some margin of ambiguity as to whether the real source of this ferocious imperative is God or the prophet who claims to speak on His behalf.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark657" class="a" name="bookmark694">you shall not spare </a><span class="s20">him</span>. The Hebrew verb <span class="s26">ḥ</span><i>amal </i>straddles two senses, to feel mercy for and to allow to survive, and the ambiguity between the emotional and the pragmatic sense is exploited throughout the story.</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark658" class="a" name="bookmark695">summoned the </a>troops<span class="p">. The word for “summoned” (there are several more common terms for mustering troops in the Bible) is quite rare, and literally means “made them listen.” The same verb as “to listen” in a different conjugation, it continues to call attention to this thematically weighted activity.</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark659" class="a">two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men of </a>Judah<span class="p">.

These overlapping imperative verbs are obviously meant to underscore the urgency of the command. The Kenites appear to have been a tribe of migratory metalsmiths (the meaning of their name) somehow allied with Israel (compare Judges 4–5), though the nature of the “kindness” they did for Israel is not known.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">9. <span class="s20">And Saul, and the troops with him, spared Agag</span>. The Hebrew says simply “Saul and the troops spared Agag,” but because a singular verb is used with the plural subject, it signals to the audience that Saul is the principal actor and the troops only accessories. (This highlighting of the first-mentioned agent through a singular verb for a plural subject is a general feature of biblical usage.) When confronted by Samuel, Saul will turn the responsibility for the action on its head. “Spared” momentarily sounds as though it could mean “had mercy on,” but then it is also attached to cattle and sheep. There is a morally scandalous pairing in the selective massacre Saul and his troops perpetrate: they kill all the defective animals and every man, woman, child, and infant, while sparing the good, edible animals and the king (perhaps with the idea that some further profit can be extracted from him).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark661" class="a" name="bookmark697">the fat </a><span class="s20">ones</span>.

Samuel is obviously harking back to Saul’s initial expression of unworthiness for the throne (“from the smallest of the tribes of Israel,” 9:21), as if to say, Well, you may not really amount to much, as you yourself said at the outset, but you nevertheless have taken upon yourself the solemn responsibility of king.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="18."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark706">&zwnj;</a>mission<span class="p">.

Samuel hammers home the thematic point of the whole confrontation: Saul, actually the initiator, proclaims he has listened to the voice of the people (verse 24)—as, ironically, Samuel himself was enjoined by God to do in Chapter 8—instead of to the voice of God. This antithesis is more pointed in the Hebrew because the more general meaning of the word for “troops,” <i>‘am</i>, is “people.”</p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark673" class="a" name="bookmark708">you pounced on the </a>booty<span class="p">.

Samuel caps his prophetic denunciation with the declamation of a prophetic poem.

The “little cloak” that Hannah would bring each year for the child Samuel has now become the prophet’s flowing robe.

The Saul story, as we shall see, will return to cloaks and to their torn or cut skirts.</span></p><ol id="l45"><li data-list-text="29."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark682" class="a" name="bookmark716">Israel’s Eternal does not deceive and does not </a>repent<span class="p">.

But might not this verbal contradiction cast some doubt on Samuel’s reliability as a source for what God does and doesn’t want? There even remains a shadow of a doubt as to whether the election of Saul in the first place was God’s, or whether it was merely Samuel’s all-too-human mistake.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="30."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark683" class="a" name="bookmark717">show me </a><span class="s20">honor</span>. Saul reverts to the recurrent term <i>kabed</i>—“honor” or “glory” (as in “glory is exiled from Israel”). Knowing that Samuel has rejected him, he implores the prophet at least to help him save face in offering the sacrifice.</p></li><li data-list-text="31."><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark684" class="a" name="bookmark718">Samuel turned back from </a><span style=" color: #00F;">Saul</span><span class="p">.

The Hebrew adverbial term <i>ma‘adanot </i>is much disputed. Some interpret it as “stumbling,” others, by a reversal of consonants, read it as “in fetters.” But the root of the word seems to point with the least strain to ‘-<i>d-n—</i>“pleasure,” “delicate thing.” That makes sense if one construes Agag’s words (the meaning of which is also in dispute) as the expression of a last illusion: I have been spared in the general massacre, and now I am brought to parlay with the chief holy man of the Hebrews for some important purpose; so surely they will not kill me.</p></li><li data-list-text="33."><p class="s32" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark686" class="a" name="bookmark720">Samuel cut him apart before the L</a>ORD<span class="p">.

In the preceding episodes, the typical form of divine communication was Samuel’s report of what God had said, although at Samuel’s first sighting of Saul, a brief direct message from God is offered. As we have observed, these reports open up a certain margin of doubt as to whether the purported divine injunctions are really God’s or Samuel’s. The present episode unfolds systematically through repeated dialogue between God and Samuel, and so God’s judgments are rendered with perfect, authoritative transparency. Evidently, the writer (or redactor) felt that the initial election of David had to be entirely unambiguous. As the story continues, God will no longer play this role of direct intervention.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark724" class="a" name="bookmark752">I have seen Me among his sons a </a><span class="s20">king</span>. The verb “to see” (<i>ra’ah</i>) followed by the preposition <i>l</i><i>e </i>has the idiomatic sense of “to provide,” but it is essential to preserve the literal meaning because this entire episode is built on the repetition of the thematically weighted word “to see,” just as the previous episode turned on “to listen.”</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark725" class="a" name="bookmark753">For should Saul hear, he will kill </a>me<span class="p">. Suddenly, a whole new political perspective is thrown on the estrangement between Samuel and Saul. The prophet may claim the higher ground of divine authority, but it is the king who has the armed divisions, and who might be ready to use them if Samuel should take any active steps to replace him. At this point, Samuel’s “grieving” over Saul begins to look like grieving over the mistake  he  made  in  first  choosing  him.  God,  understanding  Samuel’s  political predicament, suggests to him a cover story for his trip from Ramah to Bethlehem, in the tribal territory of Judah.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark726" class="a" name="bookmark754">invite Jesse to the </a><span class="s20">sacrifice</span>.

Nothing could illustrate more vividly Samuel’s persistent unreliability as seer (<i>ro’eh</i>). Having made a fatal mistake by electing Saul, “head and shoulders taller than all the people,” convinced he was directed by God, Samuel is poised to repeat his error in being impressed by the “appearance” and “lofty stature” of Jesse’s firstborn. This whole story is also a heightened and stylized playing out of the theme of the reversal of primogeniture that dominates Genesis. Instead of an elder and a younger son, Jesse has the formulaic seven sons, plus an eighth, the youngest of all, who will be chosen.</p></li><li data-list-text="7."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark758">&zwnj;</a>for I have cast him aside<span class="p">.

In the transfer of election of monarchs, one gets the picture of a kind of spiritual seesaw. As the spirit of the L<span class="s22">ORD </span>descends on and seizes David, it departs from Saul. That vacuum is promptly filled by “an evil spirit from the L<span class="s22">ORD</span>.” In the theopsychology of ancient Israel, extraordinary states were explained as investments by a divine spirit. The charisma of leadership, now passed to David, was a descent of the spirit.

This volunteered information is a bit peculiar because, before any real search is undertaken, one of the young men in court already has a candidate, and from a different tribal region. Is it possible that word of David’s clandestine anointment has circulated among limited groups, and that the anonymous “lad” may be a kind of pro-David mole in the court of Saul? It is also noteworthy that, just as at the beginning of his story, in his quest for the lost asses, Saul did not know what to do and was dependent on the counsel of his “lad” (<i>na‘ar</i>); here one of his lads (<i>ne‘arim</i>) offers the needed advice for dealing with his melancholia.</p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark743" class="a" name="bookmark771">a valiant fellow, a </a>warrior<span class="p">. These details of the characterization are surprising, for all that should be known about David is that he is a handsome shepherd boy with musical skills. The influence of the subsequent narrative has clearly made itself felt here, and these epithets may even be an editorial maneuver to harmonize this episode with the next one, in which David makes his debut before Saul not as a lyre player but as a military hero.</span></p><ol id="l49"><li data-list-text="20."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark744" class="a" name="bookmark772">a donkey laden with </a>bread<span class="p">.

And the Philistine was drawing near </a><a href="#bookmark850" class="s11">to David, the man bearing the shield before </a><a href="#bookmark851" class="s11">him. And the Philistine looked and saw David, and he despised him, for he was a lad, and ruddy, with good looks. And the Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. And the Philistine said, “Come to me, that I may give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field!” And David said to the Philistine, “</a><a href="#bookmark851" class="s12">You come to me with sword and spear and </a><span style=" color: #00F;">javelin</span>, and I come to you with the name of the L<span class="s13">ORD </span>of Armies, God of the battle lines of Israel that you have insulted.

And he reached </a><a href="#bookmark854" class="s11">his hand into the pouch and took from there a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine in his forehead, and the stone sank into his forehead and he fell on his face to the ground. And David bested the Philistine with sling and stone, and he struck down the Philistine and killed him, and no sword was in David’s hand. And David ran up and stood over the Philistine and </a><a href="#bookmark854" class="s12">took the sword from him and pulled it out of its sheath and finished him off </a><a href="#bookmark854" class="s11">and cut </a><a href="#bookmark855" class="s11">off his head with it.

As we have seen before, this positioning of the opposing armies on opposite hilltops was a characteristic procedure of warfare in the hilly terrain of central Israel. But the opening verses also set up the strong spatial perspective through which this episode is organized. The perspective of the previous story was implicitly vertical: from God above to Samuel below, in the household of Jesse in Bethlehem. Here, by contrast, is a richly elaborated horizontal deployment of troops and individuals.

This “Homeric” enumeration of armor and weapons is quite untypical of the Hebrew Bible. The thematic effect is clear: Goliath is represented as a hulking man of material military impedimenta—everything is given gargantuan size or weight, again with untypical specification. All this will be counterposed to David’s declaration on the battlefield that “not by sword nor spear does the L<span class="s22">ORD </span>deliver.”</p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark822">&zwnj;</a>five thousand bronze shekels<span class="p">.

The use of the demonstrative pronoun “this” is peculiar. It seems to be the first of several attempts (presumably, by the redactor) to harmonize this account of David’s debut in Saul’s court with the previous one, by referring to Jesse as someone already mentioned. Polzin has noted that demonstrative pronouns are unusually prominent in this whole episode: in many instances, they express contempt (“this Philistine”), but they are also sometimes necessary pointers in the emphatically spatial organization of the story.</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark789" class="s27" name="bookmark829">15. </a><a href="#bookmark789" class="a">And David would go back and forth from Saul’s </a>side<span class="p">. The last phrase has a sense close to “from Saul’s presence” and is another strategem for harmonizing the two episodes. It invites us to suppose that David divided his time between playing the lyre for Saul and tending his father’s flocks. The implicit assumption, however, of the story that unfolds is that David is unknown in the court of Saul, and that any to-and-fro movement between Bethlehem and the front would be to bring provisions to his older brothers.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark790" class="s27" name="bookmark830">17. </a>Take, pray, to your brothers<span class="p">.

It is at this point that the folkloric background of the second story of David’s </a>debut becomes particularly clear. The folktale pattern is one that is very familiar from later European tradition: a community is threatened by a giant, or ogre, or dragon that nobody can face. The king offers great wealth, and the hand of his daughter, to the man who can slay the giant. A young man from the provinces then appears on the scene, who in his youth and slight stature seems quite unfit for the daunting challenge, but by wit and resourcefulness, using unexpected means, he conquers the ogre. The appeal of this archetypal folktale no doubt made it attractive for inclusion in the David narrative. What  must  be  emphasized,  however,  is  that  the  folkloric  materials  have  been historicized and even to an extent psychologized. The slaying of the giant becomes an emblem for Israel’s prevailing over the numerically superior forces all around it as well as for the resourcefulness of its first dynastic king in securing power. The dialogue between David and his oldest brother vividly evokes a thick background of sibling jealousies. And David appears here—in the first scene in which he is assigned speech in the narrative—as a poised master of rhetoric, who knows how to use publicly enunciated words to achieve political ends.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 16pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark795" class="s27" name="bookmark835">26. </a><a href="#bookmark795" class="a">And David said . . . , “What will be done for the man . . . </a>?” <span class="p">These are David’s first recorded words in the narrative—usually, in biblical narrative convention, a defining moment of characterization. His first words express his wanting to know what will be gained—implicitly, in political terms—by the man who defeats Goliath. The inquiry about personal profit is then immediately balanced (or covered up) by the patriotic pronouncement, “who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should insult the battle lines of the living God?” David has, of course, just heard one of the troops stipulate the reward for vanquishing the Philistine, but he wants to be perfectly sure before he makes his move, and so he asks for the details to be repeated. One sees how the folktale has been artfully historicized, subtly drawn into the realm of politics and individualized character.</span></p><ol id="l52"><li data-list-text="28."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark836">&zwnj;</a><span class="s20">that bit of flock</span>. Eliab prefixes a term of diminution, <i>me‘at</i>, to “flock” to express his contempt for David.

This is a particularly striking instance of the biblical convention that can be schematized as: And X said to Y; [no response from Y]; and X said to Y, with the intervening silence being dramatically significant. Saul is nonplussed by these extravagant claims on the part of the young shepherd from Bethlehem, and he doesn’t know what to say. David, observing the skepticism of his interlocutor, now invokes God by way of explanation (“the L<span class="s22">ORD </span>who has rescued me from the lion and the bear”). This theological argument persuades Saul. For another instance of the X said to Y, X said to Y convention, compare Goliath’s boast and Israel’s silence in verses 8–10.</p></li><li data-list-text="38."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark806" class="a" name="bookmark846">his own battle </a><span class="s20">garb</span>. The Hebrew <i>madim </i>is not the ordinary term for “garment” but is most often used either for the special garments worn by men in battle or by priests in the cult (hence the present translation adds “battle”). The fact that this word is related etymologically to <i>midah</i>, proportion or measure, is relevant to the incident as it unfolds, since David is clothed in battle gear too big for him.</p></li><li data-list-text="39."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark807" class="a" name="bookmark847">he was unable to </a><span class="s20">walk</span>.

The spatial realization of the whole episode is nearing its climax: on the two hilltops, the opposing camps; in front of them, the battle lines; between the hostile lines, David and the Philistine “man between” approaching each other. In a moment, they will be close enough to exchange insults. Goliath will invite David to take the last few steps forward so that they can engage in hand-to-hand combat—“Come to me, that I may give your flesh to the birds of the heavens. . . .” Instead of traversing this final interval of space, David will surprise his adversary by taking him down with a slung stone, accurately aimed at the exposed forehead beneath his huge bronze helmet.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark811" class="s27" name="bookmark851">45. </a><a href="#bookmark811" class="a">You come to me with sword and spear and </a><span class="s20">javelin</span>. This short list of weapons harks back to the epic catalogue of weapons and armor that introduced Goliath to the story. David’s rejoinder to the Philistine is couched in impeccable terms of standard Israelite belief: as in the Psalms, it is not sword or might that gives victory but the L<span class="s22">ORD</span>. David speaks almost as though he expects to prevail through a miracle of divine intervention (“all the earth shall know that Israel has a God!”), but in fact his victory depends on his resourcefulness in exploiting an unconventional weapon, one which he would have learned to use skillfully as a shepherd.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark812" class="s27" name="bookmark852">46. </a><a href="#bookmark812" class="a">Your corpse and the </a>corpses<span class="p">.

This last gesture would encourage the Philistine to think David was rushing up for the awaited hand-to- hand combat. In fact, David is darting in close enough to get a good shot with his sling. To do this (verse 49), he will break his charge, stop, and let fly with the sling.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark814" class="s27" name="bookmark854">51. </a><a href="#bookmark814" class="a">took the sword . . . and finished him </a>off<span class="p">.

The Septuagint corrects <i>gay‘ </i>to <i>Gath</i>, with the end of this verse in mind. But there is a ravine between the two hills on which the armies are encamped, and what the narrator may be saying is that the Philistines fled westward by way of the ravine to their own territory.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark816" class="s27" name="bookmark856">54. </a><span class="s20">brought it to Jerusalem</span>. This notation is problematic because Jerusalem at this point is  still  a  Jebusite  city.  The  report  is  either  proleptic,  or  simply  out  of place chronologically. David’s bringing the sword into his tent may also be questionable because, as someone who has not been a member of the army, he would have no tent. Some scholars, influenced by the fact that Goliath’s sword later appears in the sanctuary at Nob, have proposed reading here “in the tent of the L<span class="s22">ORD</span>.”</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark817" class="s27" name="bookmark857">55. </a><a href="#bookmark817" class="a">Whose son is the lad, </a>Abner? <span class="p">It is at this point that the evident contradiction between the two stories of David’s debut is most striking. If David had been attending Saul in court as his personal music therapist, with Saul having explicitly sent a communication to Jesse regarding David’s entering his service, how could he, and Abner as well, now be ignorant of David’s identity? Efforts to harmonize the two stories in terms of the logic of later conventions of realism seem unconvincing (for example, amnesia has been proposed as a symptom of Saul’s mental illness, and Abner pretends not to recognize David in deference to the ailing king). The prevalent scholarly view that Chapters 16 and 17 represent two different traditions about David’s beginnings is persuasive. (To complicate matters, most scholars detect two different strands in Chapter 17.) What we need to ask, however, is why the redactor set these two stories in immediate sequence, despite the contradictions that must have been as evident to him as to us. A reasonable conclusion is that for the ancient audience, and for the redactor, these contradictions would have been inconsequential in comparison with the advantage gained in providing a double perspective on David. In the Greek tradition, there were competing versions of the same myths, but never in a single text. Modern Western narrative generally insists on verisimilar consistency. In the Bible, however, the variants of a single story are sometimes placed in a kind of implicit dialogue with one another (compare the two accounts of creation at the beginning of Genesis). Here, in the first, vertically oriented story, with its explicit instructions from God to man, David is emphatically elected by God, is associated with the spirit and with song, and gains entrée in the court of Saul by using song to master the spirit. In the second story, with its horizontal deployment in space, David makes his way into Saul’s presence through martial prowess, exhibiting shrewdness, calculation, and rhetorical skill. Interestingly, it is this folktale version of David’s debut rather than the theological one that will lead directly into the historical (or at least, history-like) narrative of David’s rise and David’s reign. But the redactor must surely have felt that both the “spiritual” and the political- military sides of the figure of David had to be represented in the account of his origins. It is also noteworthy that this whole episode, which launches David on his trajectory to the throne, ends with Saul once more in a state of ignorance, compelled to ask twice about David’s identity, and getting no answer until David himself speaks out.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">CHAPTER 18</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark858">&zwnj;</a><span class="s3">A</span><a href="#bookmark882" class="s6">nd it happened </a><a href="#bookmark882" class="s5">as he finished speaking with </a>Saul<a href="#bookmark883" class="s6">, that Jonathan’s very self became bound up with David’s, and </a><a href="#bookmark883" class="s5">Jonathan loved him as </a>himself<a href="#bookmark884" class="s6">.

It is noteworthy that throughout this narrative David is repeatedly the object but never the subject of the verb “to love”—in this chapter, Jonathan, the people, and Michal are all said to love David.</span></p><ol id="l54"><li data-list-text="3."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark860" class="a" name="bookmark884">And Jonathan, and David with him, sealed a </a>pact<span class="p">. This is one of the most significant instances of the expressive grammatical pattern in which there is a plural subject with a singular verb, making the first member of the plural subject the principal agent: the initiative for the pact of friendship is Jonathan’s, and David goes along with it.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark861" class="a" name="bookmark885">Jonathan took off the </a><span class="s20">cloak</span>. This gesture strongly invites comparison with Saul’s failed effort to dress David in his battle gear in the previous episode. This time David accepts the proffered garments and weapons: practically, they are presumably his own size, but he also is now ready to assume a regular role in the army. The first item Jonathan offers is his cloak, <i>me‘il, </i>the very piece of clothing Samuel associated symbolically with kingship. Bearing that in mind, J. P. Fokkelman has proposed that “with his cloak Jonathan is conveying to David the crown prince’s rights and claims to the throne.” Perhaps one should say that he is conveying these subliminally or proleptically rather than as a fully conscious act.</p></li><li data-list-text="5."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark862" class="a" name="bookmark886">Saul set him over the men of </a>war<span class="p">. The designation for fighting men is also the one Saul uses for Goliath. Moshe Garsiel has suggested that this may be a term for elite troops, and that later, when Saul appoints David captain of a thousand (verse 13), he is in effect transferring him to the position of an ordinary officer.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="6."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark887">&zwnj;</a><span class="s20">lutes</span>. As is often the case with ancient musical instruments, the precise identification of the term is in doubt. The Hebrew <i>shalishim </i>derives from <i>sheloshah</i>, three, but it could refer either to a three-stringed lute, which was fairly common in the ancient Near East, or perhaps to a triangle.</p></li></ol><ol id="l55"><li data-list-text="8."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark864" class="a" name="bookmark888">To David . . . tens of thousands and to me . . . the </a>thousands<span class="p">. It is a fixed rule in biblical poetry that when a number occurs in the first verset, it must be increased in the parallel verset, often, as here, by going up one decimal place. Saul shows himself a good reader of biblical poetry: he understands perfectly well that the convention is a vehicle of meaning, and that the intensification or magnification characteristic of the second verset is used to set David’s triumphs above his own. Saul, who earlier had made the mistake of listening to the voice of the people, now is enraged by the people’s words.</span></p><ol id="l56"><li data-list-text="10."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark889">&zwnj;</a>went into a frenzy<span class="p">. The verb here is the same one that refers to “speaking in ecstasy” or “prophesying” in the episode of Saul among the prophets, but in the present context only the connotation of raving and not that of revelation is relevant.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark866" class="s24" name="bookmark890">w</a><a href="#bookmark866" class="a">hen David was playing as he was wont </a>to<span class="p">. The present version of the story at this point seeks to integrate the account of David as victor over Goliath with the preceding report of David as Saul’s personal lyre player. Evidently, when he is not playing the lyre, he is sent out intermittently at the head of the elite troops. After this incident, Saul removes him entirely from the court by making him a regular commander. The one thing Saul cannot afford to do is to dispense with David’s brilliant services as a military leader. In the Hebrew, “was playing” is literally “was playing with his hand,” which sets</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">up a neat antithesis to the spear in Saul’s hand (“with” and “in” are represented by the same particle, <i>be </i>in Hebrew).</p></li><li data-list-text="11."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark891">&zwnj;</a>Let me strike through David<span class="p">.

This emphatic refrain-like phrase recalls the Joseph story (see especially Genesis 39), another tale of a handsome shepherd boy who ascends to regal grandeur. Like Joseph, David is repeatedly said to “succeed” (though different verbs are used in the two stories.) Allusions to the Joseph story will turn from this initial consonance to ironic dissonance.</span></p></li></ol><ol id="l57"><li data-list-text="15."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark869" class="a" name="bookmark893">Saul saw . . . and he dreaded </a>him<span class="p">. Throughout this pivotal episode, Saul’s feelings and motives remain perfectly transparent—here, through the narrator’s report of his emotions, and in the next scene, through interior monologue. At the same time, David is pointedly left opaque. No word of his is reported when Jonathan gives him his cloak and battle gear. We know that Saul is afraid of David but not whether David is afraid of Saul, who, after all, has tried to kill him. And when David speaks in the next scene, it will be manifestly a speech framed for a public occasion, which leaves his real motives uncertain.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="16."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark870" class="a" name="bookmark894">led them into the </a>fray<span class="p">.

The interior monologue leaves no doubt about Saul’s intentions. Could it be that his very transparency as a political schemer, manifested in the means of narrative presentation, is a reflection of his incapacity in the harsh realm of politics? David, by contrast, knows how to veil his motives and intentions—a veiling replicated in the narrative strategies used to present him.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="18."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark873" class="a" name="bookmark897">Who am I and who are my </a><span class="s20">kin</span>. The translation adopts a scholarly proposal of considerable currency to revocalize the Masoretic <span class="s26">ḥ</span><i>ayai</i>, “my life” as <span class="s26">ḥ</span><i>ayi</i>, “my kin,” a conjectured term based on the Arabic. David’s protestation of unworthiness recalls Saul’s when Samuel hinted he was going to confer the kingship on him. Perhaps these words are dictated by court etiquette, the commoner obliged to profess unworthiness when offered the honor of a royal connection. Perhaps the young David may actually feel unworthy of the honor. But it is also clearly in his interest to conceal from the jealous king any desire he may harbor to marry the king’s daughter, for such an alliance could be converted into an implicit claim to be successor to the throne.</p></li></ol><ol id="l58"><li data-list-text="20."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark874" class="a" name="bookmark898">And Michal the daughter of Saul loved </a>David<span class="p">. Not only is she the third party in this chapter said to love David, but she is also the only woman in the entire Hebrew Bible explicitly reported to love a man. Nothing is said, by contrast, about what David feels toward Michal, and as the story of their relationship sinuously unfolds, his feelings toward her will continue to be left in question.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="21."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark875" class="a" name="bookmark899">Through the second </a><span class="s20">one</span>. The Hebrew is quite cryptic, and the text might be defective here. Literally, it says, “through two” (<i>beshtayim</i>). This has variously been interpreted to mean: through two daughters (if not one, then the other); through two conditions (vanquishing the Philistines and bringing back their foreskins?); for two reasons (perhaps, “the king desires you” and “all his servants love you”).</p></li><li data-list-text="22."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark900">&zwnj;</a>discreetly<span class="p">. The root of the Hebrew adverb refers to covering up, but the usual translation of “secretly” is misleading.

Saul may well have counted on the fact that David would initially demur, perhaps because he was the youngest son of eight and thus lacked a suitable bride price for a princess. This refusal would then set the stage for Saul’s extravagant proposal, which he assumed would be a fatal one, of a hundred dead Philistines.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="25."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark878" class="a" name="bookmark902">The king has no desire for any bride price except a hundred Philistine </a>foreskins<span class="p">. The language Saul directs to David through his attendants—note that he now has begun to communicate with David only through intermediaries—makes it sound as though this were a small thing instead of an enormous thing. Beyond this story, there is no indication  that  the  Israelites  had  a  custom  of  collecting  the  foreskins  of  the uncircumcised Philistines like scalps. Fokkelman shrewdly notes that the foreskins are associated with (impure) sexuality and conjectures that “by this condition Saul really wants to contaminate David”—just as Saul is using his own daughter’s sexuality as a lure to destroy David. “He thinks,” Fokkelman goes on to observe, “that this rival has outdone him amongst the women and now uses woman as a trap.”</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark879" class="a" name="bookmark903">Saul had devised to make David </a>fall<span class="p">.

Moshe Garsiel has interestingly proposed that the idiom here deliberately echoes a phrase used in the Jacob story (Genesis 29:21) and signals a whole network of allusions to the Jacob narrative: in both stories the young man is a candidate to marry two sisters and gets the one not at first intended; in both stories he must provide a bride price he cannot pay for from material resources; in both stories he must “count out” (literally “fill”) payment to a devious father-in-law; eventually each man</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">flees his father-in-law, aided and abetted by his wife; and in each instance, as we shall see, household idols (<i>teraphim</i>) are involved.

As in the previous incident of the spear cast at David, the Hebrew exhibits the pointed antithesis of “his spear in his hand [<i>beyado</i>]” and David “playing by hand [<i>beyad</i>].” Conventional biblical scholarship explains the repetition of incident, and the other doublets in this narrative, as an inclusion of two versions of the same event from different sources. It is at least as plausible to assume that the author of the Saul and David narrative had a fondness for paired incidents that could be used to good literary effect. Saul’s mental disturbance involves compulsive</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">repetition. He does his best to be reconciled with David, his soothing lyre player and indispensable military leader, but the recurrent flashes of jealousy drive him again to the same lethal action.

It is striking that we are given Michal’s urgent dialogue here but not a word of response from David, only the chain of his rapid actions after she lets him down (by an improvised rope?) from the window—“he went off and fled and got away.” Perhaps this asymmetrical presentation of the two characters is meant to suggest David’s breathless flight, with no time for conversation. In any case, it continues the pattern of occluding David’s inner responses that we observed in Chapter 18. Michal is risking a great deal in order to save David.

Like Rachel, who pleads her period and does not get up from the cushions under which the <i>teraphim </i>are hidden, Michal also invokes “illness” (verse 14) to put off the searchers. Both stories feature a daughter loyal to her husband and rebelling against a hostile father. Michal puts goat’s hair at the head of the bed because, being black or dark brown, it would look like a man’s hair, but goats (and the color of their hair) are also prominent in the Jacob story. Finally, the cloth or garment (<i>beged</i>) used to cover the dummy recalls the repeated association of garments with deception in the Jacob story. Laban, of course, never finds his <i>teraphim</i>, whereas Saul’s emissaries, to their chagrin, find the <i>teraphim </i>instead of the man they are looking for.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark914" class="s27" name="bookmark932">15. </a><a href="#bookmark914" class="a">Bring him up to me in the </a>bed<span class="p">.

Some have claimed this is not a place-name but a common noun, <i>nawot</i>, “oases” (according to one suggestion, a collection of huts where the prophets resided).

In the clash between Saul and Samuel that marked their final estrangement, Samuel had explicitly associated garment with kingship. Now the frenzy that seizes Saul drives him to strip off his garments— implicitly, to divest himself of the kingship, just as the first episode of Saul among the prophets was an investment with kingship. Polzin brilliantly links this moment with Michal’s use of a garment and the contrasting narrative presentations of David and Saul: “Whereas Michal covers David’s bed with his clothes (verse 13) Saul strips off his clothes and lies naked all day and night (verse 24)—a graphic picture of how the narrator hides David and bares Saul throughout the last two chapters.”</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark923" class="a" name="bookmark941">Therefore do they say, “Is Saul, too, among the </a>prophets?” <span class="p">This is the same etiological tag as at the end of the first story of Saul among the prophets in Chapter 10.

Fokkelman states the effect nicely: “The same faculty for the numinous and the same sensitivity for suddenly being lifted into a higher state of consciousness which occurred there [in Chapter 10] under the positive sign of election, appear here under the negative sign of being rejected, and now bring Saul into a lower state of consciousness, a kind of delirium.” The conventions of verisimilitude of a later literary tradition would lead one to conclude that this encounter would have to have occurred either at the beginning of Saul’s career or at the end, but not twice.

The seeming awkwardness of the preposition is actually strategically calculated. The normal usage would be “said <i>to</i>” (’<i>el</i>). “Before” (<i>lifney</i>) is a preposition that commonly designates approach to the presence of regal or seigniorial authority. (Compare its occurrence in David’s words, “What my offense <i>before </i>your father.”) This speech is a remarkable instance of the pattern of occluding the personal side of David that we have been following. Quite strikingly, these are David’s first reported words to Jonathan, though Jonathan’s devotion to David and one speech to David (19:2–3) have been duly recorded. It is noteworthy that this is not a personal communication to Jonathan but a kind of political statement—a protestation of innocence cast in patently rhetorical language (“What have I done? What is my crime</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">. . .?”).

The last exchange between Ahimelech and David is a vivid instance of the biblical use of contrastive dialogue. The priest’s language is a wordy hesitation dance of repetitions and synonymous expressions. David responds with the most imperative succinctness (just four words in the Hebrew): “There’s none like it. Give it to me.” The fact that this huge sword might be too big for David is submerged by the symbolic notion that it is the weapon of the Philistine champion he vanquished which he now takes up. In any case, David is no longer a raw shepherd lad but a battle-hardened warrior.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="11."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1050">&zwnj;</a>he came to Achish king of Gath<span class="p">. David flees to the southwest to the one place where he imagines he will be safe from Saul’s pursuit—enemy territory. Such a crossing over to the enemy is a familiar enough move on the part of political refugees. Gath was the hometown of Goliath, and so one must assume that David planned to enter the city incognito, as an anonymous Hebrew fugitive. He would clearly have had to hide the telltale sword before coming into town.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="12."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1036" class="a" name="bookmark1051">David king of the </a>land<span class="p">. The Philistine courtiers, unfortunately, immediately identify David and can even quote the song sung by the Israelite women after his victories. Their characterization of him as “king of the land” is no doubt a tribute to his preeminence on the battlefield but also is an inadvertent confirmation of his clandestine election, of his displacing Saul. Appropriately, though, as Fokkelman notes, they use a somewhat vague designation instead of the more official “king of Israel.”</span></p></li><li data-list-text="13."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1037" class="a" name="bookmark1052">he was very afraid of </a>Achish<span class="p">.

As Shimon Bar-Efrat has nicely observed, Achish three times uses the root for raving mad (<i>meshuga‘</i>), three times the first person pronoun, and three times the root <i>b-w-’ </i>(“to bring” or “to come”). Thus David has succeeded in making himself so revolting that he arouses in Achish a primitive revulsion from the spectacle of the insane, so that the king simply wants to get David out of sight rather than have him killed. This is an extraordinary moment in the story of the founding king of Israel: David, the glamorous young hero of the preceding episodes, is prepared to do whatever is necessary in order to survive, even if it means making himself appear to be the most repulsive of humankind.

Saul’s rage over the notion that David would have neglected the new moon festivity at the palace to join his brothers in Bethlehem is given an after-the-fact political confirmation here: David’s brothers and clansmen rally round him, forming a kind of family militia. But there is a push as well as a pull in their going out to David in the badlands: if they remained in Bethlehem, they would be subject to retribution by Saul’s soldiery. David’s decision to move his parents across the border to Moab (verse 3) is another reflection of fear of royal vengeance against the family. Jesse, earlier characterized as very aged, would have been too old to join the fighting men.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1056" class="a" name="bookmark1081">every man in straits . . . in debt . . . </a>embittered<span class="p">. David’s guerilla band has a core drawn from his clan and a rank and file of the dispossessed and malcontent—men with nothing to lose who have been oppressed by the established order. David’s social base as guerilla chieftain is strongly reminiscent of Jephthah’s (Judges 11).</span></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1057" class="a" name="bookmark1082">Mizpeh of </a><span class="s20">Moab</span>. The word <i>mizpeh </i>(or in some places, <i>mizpah</i>) means “outlook” or “vista,” and so this particular Mizpeh must be identified as the one in Moab, east of the Jordan. If the Book of Ruth provides reliable genealogy, David’s great-grandmother Ruth was a Moabite, and so David here may be calling on a family connection in requesting asylum for his parents.</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1058" class="a" name="bookmark1083">all the time that David was in the </a><span class="s20">stronghold</span>. The identity of the stronghold has puzzled interpreters, especially because David is said to have set up headquarters in a cave. Some have argued that the two terms refer to the same place, but the Hebrew for “stronghold,” <i>metsudah</i>, usually refers to a height. Others read “cave,” <i>me‘arah</i>, for <i>metsudah</i>. That proposal is problematic because Adullam is in the territory of Judah, and in verse 5 David is enjoined to leave the stronghold and head for the territory of Judah. The most reasonable inference is that after the parlay with the king of Moab, David moves his fighting men from Adullam at the western border of the territory of Judah to an unspecified stronghold, probably in the craggy border region between Moab and Israel.</p></li><li data-list-text="5."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1084">&zwnj;</a>Gad the prophet<span class="p">.

The specific reference of Saul’s hearing “that David was discovered” could well be intelligence that places David’s hideout at the stronghold. That would explain why Gad urges David to move on from the stronghold to a forest in Judahite territory.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1086">&zwnj;</a>his spear in his hand<span class="p">.

As Moshe Garsiel has aptly noted, Saul’s paranoid outburst picks up key terms from Samuel’s warning about the “practice of the king” in Chapter 8. It is also noteworthy that Saul’s distraught speech takes the form of one lone onrushing sentence (all the way to the end of verse 8). Once again, Saul refers to David contemptuously solely by patronymic, as “the son of Jesse.”</span></p></li><li data-list-text="8."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1064" class="a" name="bookmark1089">none revealed to </a>me<span class="p">.

Keilah is a town on the western perimeter of the territory of Judah, facing the Philistine border. Its vulnerability to Philistine incursions is thus understandable. David’s men (verse 3) speak as though Keilah were not part of Judah because as a border town it seems to them much more dangerous than their location deep within their own tribal territory. Some scholars have speculated that Keilah was an independent town without tribal affiliation.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s32" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1104" class="a" name="bookmark1124">David inquired of the L</a>ORD<span class="p">. The means of inquiry are not specified, but since his questions invite the usual yes-or-no response, it seems likely he is using the ephod and not, as some interpreters have claimed, a more immediate mode of communication with God. The information, then, in verse 6 that the fugitive priest Abiathar has arrived from Nob with the ephod is probably retrospective. The phrase “at Keilah” (one word in Hebrew) in that verse perhaps should be deleted as an inadvertent scribal duplication of “Keilah” at the end of the preceding verse—by the testimony of Chapter 22, Abiathar fled to David when David was in the forest of Hereth in Judah, before he undertook the rescue mission to Keilah.</span></p><ol id="l71"><li data-list-text="6."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1105" class="a" name="bookmark1125">the ephod came down in his </a>hand<span class="p">. From the viewpoint of the ancient audience, the ephod would have been indispensable as an instrument of what we would call military intelligence. An ephod, we should recall, is also a priestly garment. At Nob, Saul slaughtered eighty-five priests “who wore the linen ephod.” Fokkelman perceptively describes the appearance of the oracular ephod in David’s camp as a “countermove by God”—“Saul may bloody the 85 linen priestly garments called the ephod, but the one ephod which acts as a medium for the decisive word of God turns up at the place of the alternative anointed one.”</span></p></li><li data-list-text="7."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1106" class="a" name="bookmark1126">given him in my </a><span class="s20">hand</span>.

It may seem base ingratitude on the part of the Keilah notables to betray the man who has just rescued their town from the Philistines. But they must fear Saul’s retribution should they collaborate with David at least as much as they fear the Philistines. The political paradox of the situation that has evolved is evident: David has achieved a victory against Israel’s principal enemy; Saul now moves to destroy that victor, enlisting the aid of the people David saved.</span></p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1109" class="s27" name="bookmark1129">14. </a><a href="#bookmark1109" class="a">in the wilderness in </a><span class="s20">strongholds</span>. Since the Hebrew term for strongholds (<i>metsadah </i>or <i>metsudah</i>—attempts to distinguish the two being questionable) generally occurs in wilderness settings, it seems likely that these are not built-up structures but rather natural formations that afforded effective defensive positions, such as promontories surrounded by outcroppings of rock.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1110" class="a" name="bookmark1130">in the wilderness of </a>Ziph<span class="p">.

The literal meaning of the Hebrew idiom used is “strengthened his hand in the L<span class="s22">ORD</span>.” The Hebrew thus is able to pick up the word “hand” at the beginning of Jonathan’s speech, “the hand of my father Saul shall not find you.”</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1112" class="s27" name="bookmark1132">17. </a><a href="#bookmark1112" class="a">I on my part will be your </a><span class="s20">viceroy</span>. For the second time, Jonathan makes a pact with David in which he concedes that it is David who will inherit the throne. There is a pattern of incremental repetition here: only now does Jonathan specify that he will be David’s viceroy (literally “second,” <i>mishneh</i>, but this is an ellipses for <i>mishneh lamelekh</i>, “second to the king”). The faithful Jonathan persists in his naivete, imagining that he will be able to serve as viceroy to his dear friend, who is also the man destined to displace the dynasty Saul would have established. As an alleged doublet, this episode has narrative plausibility: Jonathan first confirmed a pact with David when he told him he must flee from Saul; now, no doubt at some risk to himself, he is impelled to seek out the fugitive and beleaguered David in order to assure him of his continuing loyalty and encourage him in his adversity. Once again, characteristically, David’s response to Jonathan is not reported.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1113" class="s27" name="bookmark1133">19. </a>Ziphites<span class="p">. Since no definite article is used, this appears to be one group of Ziphites and not a delegation representing the entire clan. The motive for betraying David could equally be desire for a reward and fear of retribution should Saul discover that they had allowed David to hide out in their territory: the ruthless massacre at Nob would have been a grim object lesson duly noted throughout the Israelite populace.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1114" class="a" name="bookmark1134">in the strongholds in the forest on the hill of Hachilah to the south of the </a><span class="s20">wasteland</span>. The Ziphite informers want to make their identification of David’s whereabouts as precise as possible, hence the unusual string of geographical indications. As it emerges, the intelligence they provide is still not precise enough for the frustrated Saul, as his response (“make certain . . . when you are certain”) clearly shows. It should be said that most translators have treated the last geographical term used by the Ziphites, “the wasteland,” as a proper noun (<i>yeshimon</i>), but because it bears a definite article, and because <i>yeshimon </i>is a well-attested common noun, it is preferable not to construe it as a place-name. This episode uses three different terms for uninhabited terrain—wilderness, wasteland, and desert (or four, if one adds forest)—which has the cumulative effect of emphasizing how David is constrained to take refuge beyond the populated areas of Israel.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1115" class="s27" name="bookmark1135">21. </a><a href="#bookmark1115" class="a">you have shown pity on </a>me<span class="p">. Saul uses the same verb for pity or “sparing” that was prominently deployed in the Amalek story. The idea that the poor king, thwarted by a cunning and malicious David, needs to be shown pity is surely another manifestation of his paranoia—we might say, of its maudlin side.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1116" class="s27" name="bookmark1136">22. </a><a href="#bookmark1116" class="a">where his foot </a>treads<span class="p">.

The Hebrew reads literally, “for he has said to me,” but there is no need to emend the text because biblical Hebrew sometimes uses a third person masculine singular verb with no specified grammatical subject to perform the function of the passive.

Kyle McCarter, Jr., has made the plausible suggestion that what is indicated in this language is a pincer movement: Saul’s forces are moving around the circumference of the mountain on two sides in order to trap David between them, who is on the far side of the mountain.

This last-minute diversion of course has the effect of rescuing David from Saul, but it also points up the madness of his obsessive pursuit of David: at a time when Israel’s major national enemy is repeatedly sending troops against the territory Saul is supposed to be governing and protecting, he is devoting his attention, and his troops, to the pursuit of David.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="28."><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1121" class="a" name="bookmark1141">the Crag of the </a><span style=" color: #00F;">Divide</span><span class="p">.

Power and powerlessness are precariously balanced in this episode. David and his men are in all likelihood hiding in the far end of the cave from Saul’s search party. Had a contingent of soldiers entered the cave, they would have been trapped. Instead, Saul comes in alone, and he is in a double sense exposed to David and his men.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="5."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1145" class="a" name="bookmark1168">Here is the day that the L</a><a href="#bookmark1145" class="s21">ORD </a><a href="#bookmark1145" class="a">said to </a>you<span class="p">.

Clearly, what David feels is that he has perpetrated a kind of symbolic mutilation of the king by cutting off the corner of his garment—not with anything like a scissors, of course, but surely with his sword, his instrument  for  killing  his  enemies.  The  cloak  (<i>me‘il</i>)  has  already  been  linked emblematically with kingship in the final estrangement between Samuel and Saul, and so David is in symbolic effect “cutting away” Saul’s kingship. For all the remorse he feels, he will continue to make double use of the corner of the cloak, as we shall see.</p></li><li data-list-text="7."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1149" class="a" name="bookmark1172">that I should have done this thing to my master, the L</a><a href="#bookmark1149" class="s21">ORD</a><a href="#bookmark1149" class="a">’</a><a href="#bookmark1149" class="s21">S </a>anointed<span class="p">. Some interpreters have read this whole episode as an apology for David’s innocence and piety in relation to Saul. But the very gesture of piety is also self-interested—David, after all,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">is conscious that he, too, is the L<span class="s22">ORD</span>’<span class="s22">S </span>anointed, and it is surely in his long-term interest that the reigning king’s person should be held sacred by all his subjects.</p></li><li data-list-text="8."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1150" class="a" name="bookmark1173">David held back his </a><span class="s20">men</span>. The meaning of the verb <i>shisa‘ </i>is disputed, but it is most plausibly linked with the noun <i>shesa‘</i>, a split or cleft. The sense here would then be: he “split off” his men from Saul, using his words to interpose a kind of barrier between them and the king. In any case, the first clause of this verse appears to respond to the men’s initial inclination to kill Saul (verse 5) rather than following from David’s remorse over the cutting of the garment—a chronological displacement noted as early as Rashi.</p></li><li data-list-text="9."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1151" class="a" name="bookmark1174">David . . . came out of the cave and called after </a>Saul<span class="p">. David is taking a calculated risk. Saul could, after all, order his troops to attack David and the men behind him in the cave. David first throws Saul off his guard by paying obeisance to him as king and prostrating himself—hardly what one would expect of a fugitive or rebel. He then counts on the persuasive power of his own rhetoric, and on the telltale scrap of the king’s cloak that he clutches, to deflect Saul from his lethal intentions. David is cannily self-protective but he is also a gambler.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="10."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1152" class="s27" name="bookmark1175">–11. </a><a href="#bookmark1152" class="a">Why should you listen to people’s words . . . ? . . . this day your eyes have </a>seen<span class="p">.

It is, appropriately, ambiguous whether “my father” is a form of respectful address to an authority or an attempt to reach back to the moment of affectionate intimacy in their relationship. We may note that David, for all the remorse he felt over having cut off the skirt of Saul’s garment, makes great display of it now as evidence of having had Saul entirely at his mercy. The proof of his innocence is thus inseparable from the reminder of the power he had over his rival.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="13."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1155" class="a" name="bookmark1178">Let the L</a><a href="#bookmark1155" class="s21">ORD </a><a href="#bookmark1155" class="a">judge between me and you . . . the L</a><a href="#bookmark1155" class="s21">ORD </a><a href="#bookmark1155" class="a">will avenge me of </a>you<span class="p">.

But there is also the distinct hint that the wicked person in question could be Saul himself. Though David cannot know this, Saul will die by his own hand.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1158" class="a" name="bookmark1181">but my hand will not be against </a>you<span class="p">. The words that the writer attributes to David ironically echo the words of Saul’s first murderous plot against David, conveyed in interior monologue, when Saul said, “Let not my hand be against him but let the hand of the Philistines be against him” (18:17).</span></p></li><li data-list-text="15."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1159" class="a" name="bookmark1182">has the king of Israel come </a>forth<span class="p">.

In his peroration, David outdoes himself in professing his humble station. A dead dog was proverbial in ancient Israel as a contemptible, worthless thing, but David goes the idiom one better by saying he is scarcely more important than a single flea on the dead dog’s carcass, a brilliant adaptation to prose of the logic of intensification of biblical poetry, in which a term introduced in the first part of the line is raised to the second power semantically in the parallel second half.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="16."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1161" class="a" name="bookmark1184">judge me against </a>you<span class="p">. The Hebrew is literally “judge me from your hand,” that is, judge me favorably and rescue me from your hand. The term thus picks up the insistence on “hand” throughout David’s speech.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="17."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1185">&zwnj;</a>Is this your voice, my son, David? <span class="p">These first words of Saul’s response to David are one of the most breathtaking instances of the biblical technique of contrastive dialogue. David’s speech had been, by biblical standards, quite lengthy, and very much a speech</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">—a beautifully crafted piece of rhetoric, with complex political aims in mind. Saul responds with four choked Hebrew words, <i>haqolkha zeh beni Dawid</i>? His designation of David as “my son” is free of the ambiguity attached to David’s calling him “my father.” This is one of those extraordinary reversals that make biblical narrative such a probing representation of the oscillations and the unpredictability of human nature: David’s words have cut to the quick of the king’s conscience, and suddenly the obsessive pursuer feels an access of paternal affection, intertwined with remorse, for his imagined enemy. Saul asks his question because he has to shake himself to believe his enemy is his friend, because he stands at a certain distance from David (who has called out “after” Saul), and also because his eyes are blinded with tears. He is thus reminiscent of the blind father Isaac, who was able to make out the voice, but not the identity, of his son Jacob, and from whom a blessing was wrested.</p></li><li data-list-text="18."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1163" class="a" name="bookmark1186">You are more in the right than </a>I<span class="p">.

This marks Saul’s first open admission that David is the “fellowman who is better than you” of whom Samuel spoke.

On the face of it, this is an improbable name because <i>nabal </i>in Hebrew plainly means “base fellow,” “churl,” or “fool,” as Abigail (verse 25) will point out.

The compact Hebrew phrase </span>koh le<span class="s26">ḥ</span>ay <span class="p">occurs only here, and its meaning has been disputed. This translation adopts an interpretation that goes back to Rashi, which is based on the similarity to a well-known idiom, </span>ka‘et <span class="s26">ḥ</span>ayah<span class="p">.That would make sense in terms of the narrative situation: the prosperous Nabal is obviously “faring well” at the moment, and David’s greeting of peace (to fare well in the Hebrew idiom is to possess </span>shalom<span class="p">) contains a veiled threat—let us hope that you continue to fare well a year from now.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="7."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1195" class="a" name="bookmark1234">we did not humiliate </a>them<span class="p">.

The message is that David’s men did not permit themselves to take any of Nabal’s flock, and perhaps also that as armed men they defended Nabal’s people against marauders (compare verse 16, “They were a wall around us both night and day”). But there is a certain ambiguity as to whether David was providing protection out of sheer good will or conducting a protection racket in order to get the necessary provisions for his guerilla band.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="8."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1197" class="a" name="bookmark1236">our </a>lads<span class="p">.

The time of sheep shearing was a sort of holiday, with feasting and drinking. Nabal’s own feast back home at Maon (verse 36) may have been encouraged by the festivities in which he joined with his shearers out in the field.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1199" class="a" name="bookmark1238">Give, pray, whatever you can to your </a>servants<span class="p">.

This is an expression of deference or humility to the powerful and presumably older Nabal. It also strikes an ironic note of correspondence with the language of David’s encounter with Saul at the cave near Ein-Gedi in the previous episode. There, David addressed Saul as “my father,” and the king, in an access of feeling, called David “my son.”</span></p><ol id="l76"><li data-list-text="10."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1201" class="a" name="bookmark1240">Who is David and who is the son of </a>Jesse? <span class="p">This sarcastic question, in verse-like parallelism,  picks  up  another  ironic  correspondence  with  Saul,  who  after  the vanquishing of Goliath asked whose son this was. In Nabal’s case, of course, the question expresses the contempt of a rich landowner for David and his ragtag band of dispossessed men and malcontents (“men who come from I know not where”).</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1202" class="a" name="bookmark1241">many are the slaves breaking away from their </a>masters<span class="p">. On the surface, these words reflect the disdain of a propertied man (who would also be a slave-holder) for all landless rebels who threaten the established social hierarchy. But there is also a barbed hint that David himself is a slave or subject (the same word in Hebrew) who has rebelled against his master, Saul.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="11."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1202" class="a" name="bookmark1242">shall I take my bread and my </a>water<span class="p">. The Septuagint has “wine” instead of “water.” In any case, Nabal’s harsh and contemptuous response to David’s men vividly illustrates that he is a “hard” man, and a churlish one. His outrage over the notion of parting with any of his possessions is nicely indicated, as Shimon Bar-Efrat has noted, by the fact that there are eight grammatical expressions of the first person singular in this one sentence.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="12."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1203" class="a" name="bookmark1243">Every man, gird his </a>sword! <span class="p">The angry David wastes no words: he merely gives the urgent command to take up weapons and move out for the kill.</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1204" class="s27" name="bookmark1244">15. </a><a href="#bookmark1204" class="a">And the men have been very good to </a>us<span class="p">. In keeping with the general practice of biblical dialogue, the servant recycles the language of David’s message to Nabal—“we were not humiliated and we missed nothing the whole time”—but amplifies it by adding this clause as well as the image in the next verse, “They were a wall around us both night and day.” He thus makes emphatically clear that David’s men really provided protection faithfully, whether in the simple sense or in the racketeering sense.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1205" class="s27" name="bookmark1245">17. </a><a href="#bookmark1205" class="a">And now, mark and see what you must </a>do<span class="p">. Unlike the “lads” who address Saul, this one offers no specific advice to Abigail, for she is more than clever enough to figure out what steps she must immediately take.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1206" class="s27" name="bookmark1246">20. </a><a href="#bookmark1206" class="a">And so she was riding on the donkey coming down under the cover of the mountain and, look, David and his men were coming</a><a href="#bookmark1206" class="s27">. The two parties moving toward each </a>other introduce a moment of suspense, for David, after all, as the next verse (with a pluperfect verb) makes utterly clear, is armed and angry. The “look” (<i>hineh</i>) is used in characteristic fashion to indicate Abigail’s visual perspective: he at first doesn’t see her because she is coming down the sheltered slope of the mountain, but she sees him and his men with their swords girded ready for battle.</p><ol id="l77"><li data-list-text="22."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1207" class="a" name="bookmark1247">a single pisser against the </a>wall<span class="p">. The literal meaning of the Hebrew is properly followed in the King James Version, as it is in this translation. The phrase, of course, is a rough and vivid epithet for “male,” and one that occurs only in curses. Its edge of vulgarity seems perfectly right for David’s anger.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="23."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1208" class="s27" name="bookmark1248">–24. </a>flung herself on her face . . . bowed to the ground . . . flung herself at his feet<span class="p">. In a world where an angry king could massacre every man, woman, and child in Nob, Abigail has no way of knowing whether David will have an impulse to kill her on the spot. (She has not heard the words that limit the threat of slaughter to the males.) Thus,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">her first move in this highly dangerous situation, before she speaks a word, is to demonstrate her absolute submission to David through these extravagant gestures of obeisance.</p></li><li data-list-text="24."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1249">&zwnj;</a><span class="s20">Mine</span>. The shrewdness of her extraordinary speech begins with the very first syllable she utters. She immediately takes all the blame on herself, though in the next breath she will be sure to transfer it heartily to her contemptible husband. At the same time, she exploits a momentary pun, for the word <i>bi </i>(“mine,” “in me”) in other contexts can mean “I beseech you,” so she initiates her address to David with what sounds like a term of imploring.</p></li><li data-list-text="25."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1210" class="a" name="bookmark1250">this scoundrel of a man . . . his name means Base . . . And as for </a><span class="s20">me</span>. It is hard to think of another instance in literature in which a wife so quickly and so devastatingly interposes distance between herself and her husband. She rapidly denounces her spouse and then counterposes herself (“And as for me,” <i>wa’ani</i>) as a person who had no part in the rude rejection of David’s emissaries. Abigail of course wants to save her own neck, but she clearly has been chafing over her marriage with a boorish, unpleasant, and probably older man, and she sees an opportunity here.</p></li><li data-list-text="26."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1251">&zwnj;</a>Who kept you from coming into blood guilt<span class="p">.

The obvious sense of “blessing” (<i>berakhah</i>) in context is “gift,” but the primary meaning of the word is worth preserving for two reasons. First, it is clearly intended to answer to David’s reiterated use of “blessed” in his response to Abigail. Then, as Moshe Garsiel has aptly observed, it is a key term in a network of allusions to the moment in Genesis 33 when Jacob is reunited with his brother Esau: Esau, too, approaches dauntingly with four hundred armed men; Jacob, like Abigail, prostrates himself before the figure he fears; and he, too, has brought with him generous tribute to be offered in conciliation, which he refers to not as a “gift” (<i>minha</i><span class="s26">ḥ</span>) but as a “blessing.” And in Genesis 33, that term plays back against the fraught meanings of “blessing” in the larger Jacob-Esau narrative.</p></li><li data-list-text="28."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1213" class="a" name="bookmark1253">Forgive, pray, the crime of your </a>servant<span class="p">. “Servant” is in the feminine, but the conventional “handmaiden” sounds too fussy.

The generality of “a person” (’<i>adam</i>) picks up David’s use of the same word in the preceding episode when he addresses Saul (“Why should you listen to people’s words” [<i>divrey ’adam</i>]), and, even more pointedly, recalls his very first speech to Saul in 17:32, “Let no man’s heart [<i>lev’ adam</i>] fail him,” where the term seems to refer to Saul himself, who may be the hidden referent here.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1217" class="a" name="bookmark1257">bound in the bundle of the </a><span class="s20">living</span>. Although Kyle McCarter, Jr., following Tur-Sinai, has claimed that “bundle” (<i>tsror</i>) actually means document or book, a more plausible identification is the pouch in which little stones keeping a tally of live sheep were placed. Thus both this positive image and the negative one of the slingshot would be associated with sheepherding. And as Shimon Bar-Efrat had nicely observed, <i>tsror </i>in biblical Hebrew also means “stone,” the object that would normally be placed in the hollow of the sling; so there is a punning cross-link between the two images.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1258">&zwnj;</a>will sling from the hollow of the sling<span class="p">.

These final words of Abigail’s lengthy and carefully calculated speech are strategically chosen, and discreet. What, in fact, does she have in mind? The Israeli novelist, Meir Shalev, in a perceptive and lively essay on this story, makes a bold and, to my mind, persuasive proposal. Abigail has matrimony in view, once her cantankerous old husband is out of the way, but why does she think she will deserve so signal an honor, or reward, from David? Shalev argues that when Abigail dissuades David from killing Nabal, repeatedly assuring him that the L<span class="s22">ORD </span>will pay off David’s scores against him, she is really suggesting herself as the agency for “the L<span class="s22">ORD</span>.” She is, in other words, proposing to David that she carry out a kind of contract killing of her husband, with the payoff that she will become the wife of the handsome young warrior and future king.</p></li><li data-list-text="32."><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1221" class="s27" name="bookmark1261">–34. </a><a href="#bookmark1221" class="s24">David, though persuaded by </a>Abigail’s <span style=" color: #000;">prudent advice, cannot resist one last reminder that he was indeed about to cut down every pisser against the wall in the house of Nabal.</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1222" class="s27" name="bookmark1262">36. </a><a href="#bookmark1222" class="a">And she told him </a>nothing<span class="p">.

The terrifying information that David had been on his way—or did she say, was still on his way?—with four hundred armed men intent on mayhem triggers a paralyzing heart attack or, perhaps, a stroke (the biblical understanding of physiology not being ours). Abigail gives the distinct appearance of counting on her husband’s cowardice and on a bad heart she might have been aware of from previous manifestations of ill health. If this assumption is correct, she would be using her knowledge of his physical frailty to carry out the tacit contract on his life—bloodlessly, with God Himself left to do the deed (compare the end of verse 38). Polzin perceptively notes that the figurative use of the stone for paralysis cinches a circle of images: the enemies flung from the hollow of the sling and the smooth stone with which David killed Goliath.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1225" class="s27" name="bookmark1265">39. </a><a href="#bookmark1225" class="a">David . . . spoke out for </a><span class="s20">Abigail</span>. In biblical idiom, the verb “to speak” followed by the preposition <i>b</i><i>e </i>instead of the usual ’<i>el </i>(“to”) means to enter into discussion about a betrothal.

In one last flourish of the etiquette of humility, she professes herself unworthy of so great an honor as to become David’s wife.

The legality of this act is questionable. David’s having taken two wives—of Ahinoam all we know is her place of origin—while hiding out from Saul is no justification because, given the practice of polygamy, he could have done that even if he were living under the same roof with Michal. Saul’s motive is political, to deprive David of one claim to the throne by removing the connection through marriage with the royal family. But that connection has already been established, as the narrator’s identification of Michal as “David’s wife” is meant to remind us. We can only guess what Michal, who we know loved David, feels about being passed around in this fashion, or what she feels about the man her father has imposed on her. Later, we will be accorded a brief but unforgettable glimpse into Palti’s feelings for Michal.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">CHAPTER 26</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1293" class="s28" name="bookmark1268">A</a><a href="#bookmark1293" class="s5">nd the Ziphites came to Saul at </a><span style=" color: #00F;">Gibeah</span><a href="#bookmark1294" class="s6">, saying, “Is not David hiding out at the hill of Hachilah facing the wasteland?” And Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, and with him three thousand picked men of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.

This verse, echoing much of the language of 23:19, announces the beginning of the last of the elaborately paired episodes that structure the story of David and Saul. Scholarly consensus assumes that these doublets reflect different sources or traditions bearing on the same events, though the possibility cannot be rejected out of hand that the original writer may have deliberately composed his story with paired incidents. In any case, the pairings need to be read as part of the purposeful compositional design of the redacted version of the narrative that we have. As the Russian Formalist critic Viktor Shklovsky observed long ago, every parallelism in a literary text serves to point up a certain semantic difference. Here, we note at the outset that the elaborately detailed intelligence about David’s whereabouts provided by the Ziphites in 23:19 is largely absent from this briefer account: this story will prove to be an <i>inversion </i>of the earlier one, David discovering Saul instead of the other way around. Another indication that the doublet is manipulated as an element of purposeful design is the fact that this episode simultaneously repeats <i>two different </i>previous</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">episodes—not only the earlier story of Saul’s pursuit of David into the wilderness of Ziph but also the encounter between David and Saul at the cave near Ein-Gedi (Chapter 24). There, just as here, David refused to kill Saul when he, or one of his men, could have done so, and there he professed his innocence to a remorseful Saul who called him as he does here, “my son, David.”</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1269" class="s27" name="bookmark1294">3. </a>he saw that Saul had come after him<span class="p">. The placement of this second account of pursuit in the wilderness of Ziph after Saul’s solemn pledge in Chapter 24 not to harm David underlines the compulsive character of his obsession with David. Whatever his avowed good intentions, Saul cannot restrain his impulse to destroy his rival. There is thus strong narrative logic in the recurrence: after this last encounter with Saul, David will sensibly conclude that he can no longer trust the king’s professions of good faith, and he will take flight beyond the borders of Israel.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1270" class="s27" name="bookmark1295">4. </a><a href="#bookmark1270" class="a">David sent spies and he knew with </a><span class="s20">certainty</span>. In contrast to the episode in Chapter 23, it is David here who commands military intelligence. The writer makes this point neatly by using the same (relatively unusual) phrase, <i>’el nakhon</i>, “with certainty,” which in Chapter 23 was spoken by Saul, referring to the information about David he expected to get from the Ziphites.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1271" class="s27" name="bookmark1296">6. </a>Ahimelech the Hittite<span class="p">. In biblical usage, “Hittite” is a loose designation for Canaanite peoples and does not necessarily refer to the Indo-European group that originated in Anatolia. The presence of a foreigner in David’s inner circle of warriors suggests an openness of his band of disaffected men to adventure seekers, freebooters, and other mobile types in the Canaanite population. Ahimelech is nowhere else mentioned in the biblical record, which has led some scholars to infer that the mention of this foreigner may be an authentic early notice of a historical personage.

Again, the placement of this version of the paired episodes is telling, for the next time we see Saul in the narrative he will be undone on the battlefield by the Philistines and will turn his own weapon against himself.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1303">&zwnj;</a>and the water jug<span class="p">.

The L<span class="s22">ORD</span>’<span class="s22">S </span>inheritance clearly refers to the land of Israel. Since every national region had its own cult, David is saying that to be excluded from his own national borders is tantamount to being obliged to worship other gods. In fact, his flight from Saul has been mostly within Israelite territory, but he seems to be anticipating that his next move, for his own safety, will have to be into Philistine country.</p></li><li data-list-text="20."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1288" class="a" name="bookmark1313">to seek a single flea, as he would chase a partridge in the </a><span class="s20">mountains</span>. The language of the entire clause recycles the words David used to conclude his speech outside the cave. But the dead dog has been deleted and a partridge has been introduced instead. This image is less forceful, but its attraction in the Hebrew, as several commentators have noted, is a witty pun: partridge (<i>qore’</i>) is a homonym for “he who calls out.” David (verse 14) was identified by Abner as the one who called out to the king—a caller out on the mountain, a partridge pursued on the mountains.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1289" class="s27" name="bookmark1314">22. </a><a href="#bookmark1289" class="a">And David answered and said, “Here is the king’s </a><span class="s20">spear.” </span>It is noteworthy that David does not immediately respond to Saul’s renewed profession of regret and good faith.  (The  Masoretic  consonantal  text,  the  <i>ketiv</i>,  tries  to  rescue  this  lapse  by representing these words as a vocative, “Here is the spear, king,” but the <i>qeri</i>, or pronounced Masoretic version, properly renders it as <span class="s26">ḥ</span><i>anit hamelekh</i>, “the king’s spear.”) In the encounter at the cave, David vowed he would not harm Saul’s descendants, though his actual words were not reported. Here, he first gives an impersonal order to have the spear brought back to Saul. It is only when he goes on to recapitulate his profession of innocence that he again addresses Saul. By this point, he no longer trusts any promises Saul may make not to harm him but hopes that God will note his own proper conduct and therefore protect him (verse 24).</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1290" class="s27" name="bookmark1315">24. </a><a href="#bookmark1290" class="a">I valued your life </a>highly<span class="p">.

This is the first actual interior monologue given for David. The decision to “cross over” (verse 2) to the enemy is a momentous one, and the writer wants to make it perfectly clear that David had definitively realized Saul was bound to kill him sooner or later (“I shall perish one day by the hand of Saul”) unless he moved to the safety of enemy territory.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1319" class="a" name="bookmark1335">he crossed over . . . to Achish . . . king of </a>Gath<span class="p">. For those scholars who have argued that David is no more a historical figure than King Arthur, this whole episode constitutes a problem: why would a much later, legendary, and supposedly glorifying tradition attribute this act of national treachery to David? (It would be rather like the invention of a story that Winston Churchill spent 1914–1918 in Berlin, currying the favor of the kaiser.) The compelling inference is that the writer had authentic knowledge of a period when David collaborated with the Philistines; he was unwilling to omit this uncomfortable information, though he did try to mitigate it.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1320" class="a" name="bookmark1336">David stayed with Achish in Gath . . . each man with his </a>household<span class="p">. The circumstances have changed drastically since David arrived in Gath alone and was obliged to play the madman. Now he comes with six hundred men under his command, a fighting unit that could be of great use to Achish, and essentially offers to become Achish’s vassal.

There might be a textual distortion here: several versions of the Septuagint read “the inhabited land from Telem to Shur.” But the Masoretic version has a certain logic: what David sets out to do is to attack the age-old inhabitants of the land, who are Israel’s staunch enemies, throughout this southern region. In doing this, he is also serving Achish’s purposes, for these peoples are equally hostile to the Philistines (like the Israelites, latecomer interlopers in Canaan).</span></p></li><li data-list-text="9."><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1325" class="a" name="bookmark1341">he left not a man or woman </a><span class="s20">alive</span>.

This second obituary notice for Samuel, with a pluperfect verb, is introduced in order to set the stage for the conjuration of Samuel’s ghost.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1351" class="a" name="bookmark1375">Saul had taken away the ghosts and the familiar spirits from the </a><span class="s20">land</span>. The two Hebrew terms, <i>’ovot </i>and <i>yid‘onim</i>, are generally paired, and both refer to the spirits of the dead. (The latter is derived from the verbal root <i>y-d-</i>‘“to know,” and so prepares the way for the reappearance of the theme of [withheld] knowledge that has been stalking Saul from the beginning of his story.) The ghosts and familiar spirits are linked metonymically with the necromancers who call them up—it is the latter who of course would have been the actual object of Saul’s purge—but the terms themselves primarily designate the spirits. Biblical views about post-mortem existence tend to fluctuate. Often, the dead are thought to be swallowed up in “the Pit” (<i>she’ol</i>) where they are simply silenced, extinguished forever. Sometimes, the dead are imagined as continuing a kind of shadowy afterlife in the underworld, rather like the spirits of the dead in Book 11 of the Odyssey. Following on this latter view, necromancy in the ancient Hebrew world is conceived not as mere hocus-pocus but as a potentially efficacious technology of the realm of spirits, which, however, has been prohibited by God, Who wants no human experts interfering in this realm. Saul, then, has been properly upholding monotheistic law—reflected in Leviticus—in proscribing necromancy, but in his desperation, he is now about to violate his own prohibition.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1352" class="s27" name="bookmark1376">6. </a><a href="#bookmark1352" class="a">the L</a><a href="#bookmark1352" class="s21">ORD </a><a href="#bookmark1352" class="a">did not </a>answer<span class="p">.

The narrative motivation is obvious: as the very ruler who has made necromancy a capital crime (see verse 9), Saul can scarcely come to engage the services of a necromancer unless he is disguised as a commoner. But his disguise also is the penultimate instance of the motif of royal divestment. As we have seen, clothing is associated with Saul’s kingship—the torn or cut garment is the tearing of his kingship, and among the ecstatics surrounding Samuel, Saul stripped himself naked. Now, in an unwitting symbolic gesture, he divests himself of his royal garments before going to learn of his own impending death.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="9."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1354" class="a" name="bookmark1378">you yourself </a>know<span class="p">.

In place of the more abstract term, “to take away,” used by the narrator in verse 3, she, from her perspective as a threatened practitioner, chooses the violent verb, “to cut off.”</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1356" class="a" name="bookmark1380">why do you entrap </a>me<span class="p">.

The irony of Saul’s doing this in a negotiation with a conjurer of spirits is vividly caught by the Midrash: “Whom did Saul resemble at that moment? A woman who is with her lover and swears by the life of her husband” (Yalkut Shimoni 2:247:139).</span></p></li></ol><ol id="l84"><li data-list-text="12."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1358" class="a" name="bookmark1382">the woman saw Samuel and she screamed in a loud </a><span class="s20">voice</span>. What terrifies her is not the apparition of Samuel but the sudden realization of the identity of her nocturnal visitor. How does she know it is Saul? The most persuasive explanation has been offered by Moshe Garsiel. As other biblical references to conjuration of the dead suggest, the usual method would be for the necromancer to listen to and interpret the supposed “chirping” (<i>tsiftsuf</i>) or murmuring sounds made by shadows or wispy wraiths believed to be the presences of the dead. (There is scant biblical evidence for the claim that the necromancer was a medium from whose throat the ghost spoke.) In this case, however, the spirit appears not as a murmuring wisp or shadow but as the distinctly defined image of Samuel, in his prophet’s cloak (see verses 13–14), and the woman of Ein-Dor immediately realizes that it is only for the king that the prophet Samuel would have thus risen from the underworld in full-body image. It is noteworthy that the narrator is discreetly silent about the actual mechanics of the conjuration procedure, perhaps out of a kind of monotheistic reticence.</p></li><li data-list-text="13."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1359" class="a" name="bookmark1383">Do not </a><span class="s20">fear</span>. <i>But what do you see? </i>Saul assures her that even though he is the very king who prohibited necromancy, he will stand by his vow that no blame will be</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">attached to her. What he urgently wants to know is the identity of the conjured presences—she can see the spirit, but he cannot, so once more Saul needs some mediation for the knowledge he seeks.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1360" class="a" name="bookmark1384">A god do I see rising up from the </a><span class="s20">earth</span>. The Hebrew balances precariously on a linguistic ambiguity that has no happy English equivalent. The word for “god” here is ’<i>elohim</i>, which when treated grammatically as a singular (it has a plural ending) usually means God. In the plural, it often refers to “gods” in the polytheistic sense. It also occasionally means “angel” or “divine being,” and some have argued, unconvincingly, that it sometimes means “judge.” A further complication here is that the ghostwife uses <i>’elohim </i>with a plural participle (and hence the King James Version renders it as “gods”). It seems likely that the grammatical crossover we have just reviewed encouraged a fluidity of usage in which the plural might sometimes be employed with a singular sense, even when the referent was not the one God. In the immediately following question and response between Saul and the woman, it is presupposed that she has seen only one male figure, and the narrator has already told us she has seen Samuel. When she says she sees <i>’elohim </i>rising up, she probably means an imposing figure like unto a god or an angel, or perhaps she is using it as a term for “spirit.”</p></li><li data-list-text="14."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1361" class="a" name="bookmark1385">wrapped in a </a><span class="s20">cloak</span>. It is the cloak, <i>me‘il</i>, that clinches the identification for Saul— the same prophet’s cloak that he clung to and tore. From childhood, when Samuel’s mother would make him a new <i>me‘il </i>each year, to the grave, Samuel is associated with this garment.</p></li><li data-list-text="15."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1362" class="a" name="bookmark1386">Why have you troubled me . . . </a>? <span class="p">In perfect character, Samuel begins by addressing an angry question to Saul, using a verb that refers to disturbing a person from sleep, or from the sleep of death. In divergence from the usual necromantic procedure, the ghost of Samuel speaks directly to Saul, who in turn questions Samuel himself. In fact, the ghostwife appears to have absented herself at this point, for the indication in verse 21, “And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was very distraught,” is that she is returning to the room after having left it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1363" class="a" name="bookmark1387">I am in dire straits, and the Philistines are fighting . . . and God has turned away . . . and I called to you</a><a href="#bookmark1363" class="s27">.

As this particular clause highlights, Samuel’s entire speech is a recapitulation of the denunciatory speech he made to Saul at the end of the Amalek episode (Chapter 15). The tearing of the kingship “from your hand” visually recalls Saul’s hand grasping the torn skirt of Samuel’s cloak. There,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Samuel had said God would give the throne to “your fellowman, who is better than you.” Now, of course, he can spell out the name David.</p></li><li data-list-text="18."><p class="s32" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1367" class="a" name="bookmark1391">you did not heed the voice of the L</a>ORD<span class="p">. The phrasal motif of “heeding the voice” from Chapter 15 is again invoked.

Saul, having come to seek advice on the eve of a great battle, is given a denunciation concluding with a death sentence, conveyed in these words with spooky immediacy, as the ghost of Samuel beckons Saul and his sons down into the underworld. This entire scene is conceivably one of the inspirations for Macbeth’s encounter with the three witches, though the biblical writer, in contrast to Shakespeare, places it at the penultimate moment of his doomed king’s story.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1369" class="a" name="bookmark1393">The camp of Israel, too . . </a>. <span class="p">There is no need to perform textual surgery on this sentence simply because it repeats the burden of the first sentence of the verse.

Most translators have interpreted the second verb here as an involuntary one (“fell”). But the verb “to hasten” (<i>miher</i>) is generally part of a sequence of voluntary actions, as its use in verse 24 (“and she hastened and butchered it and took”) neatly illustrates. Saul, in his terror and despair, flings himself to the ground, and then scarcely has the strength to get up. The Hebrew for “full length” includes the component <i>qomah</i>, “stature,” and so is a reminder that the man of majestic stature is now cast to the ground in final defeat.</p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1371" class="a" name="bookmark1395">for he had eaten no </a>food<span class="p">. There is no convincing evidence to support the claim of some scholars that a person had to fast before seeing a necromancer. Perhaps Saul’s fasting is a reflex of his distraught condition, but he may well be fasting because he is about to enter into battle. (It appears that his two bodyguards have also not eaten.) This would invite a connection, which has been made by both Fokkelman and Garsiel, with the vow of abstinence from food that Saul earlier imposed on his troops (Chapter 15). There, he was ready to put Jonathan to death for having tasted a bit of honey; here, he will end by partaking of a feast.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1372" class="s27" name="bookmark1396">22. </a><a href="#bookmark1372" class="a">a morsel of </a>bread<span class="p">.

The “all” stresses that this is a massing of the entire Philistine army, not merely a division or two, for a decisive confrontation with the Israelites. As Polzin notes, the first major clash with the Philistines in 1 Samuel began with the Philistines’ camping at Aphek (4:1), so the mention of their encampment here at the same site creates a kind of symmetrical frame for the book. Aphek is roughly forty miles south of Jezreel, not far from Philistine territory, and would have served as a general staging ground. The Philistine army then advances northward to camp at Shunem (27:4), just opposite Saul’s forces at the spring of Jezreel and near Mount Gilboa.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1399" class="a" name="bookmark1414">David and his men were advancing at the rear with </a>Achish<span class="p">. Given David’s double role as Achish’s vassal and as his special bodyguard, his position in battle should have been alongside Achish. Until this mention of David, we might have imagined that the report of the deployment of forces was a direct continuation of the account of Saul’s seance at Ein-Dor on the night before the battle. Now it rapidly becomes clear that the narrative has again switched tracks from Saul to David, suspending the fulfillment of Saul’s dire fate in order to follow the movement of his successor, who approaches the very same battlefield as part of the enemy forces, only to be turned away. The switch in narrative focus also involves backtracking in time: we left Saul in the dark of the night (also a symbolic darkness for him); the deployment of armies and the Philistine dialogues take place on the previous day; David’s early departure, “just when it is brightening” (an antithesis to Saul in the dark, as Fokkelman notes), will be on the morning of the battle.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1400" class="a" name="bookmark1415">the Philistine </a><span class="s20">captains</span>.

Some scholars suspect that these two terms reflect a conflated text, and that one should simply read “these many days.” It could, however, make sense for Achish to be a little vague about the time and to exaggerate it in order to emphasize David’s loyalty—in fact, David has been with him one year and two months.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1419">&zwnj;</a>fell in with me<span class="p">.

Some scholars, following the Septuagint, read here “you are good,” contending that Achish claims a difference of opinion between the overlords and the captains. It makes better sense simply to assume that he is referring the negative view of David to the highest echelon of authority, though in fact the complaint came from the field commanders.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1409" class="s27" name="bookmark1425">8. </a><a href="#bookmark1409" class="a">what have I done . . . that I should not . . . do battle with the enemies of my lord the king? </a><a href="#bookmark1409" class="s27">Continuing to play the role of the perfect Philistine vassal, David protests </a>his eagerness to fight the Israelites, though in point of fact he must be immensely relieved to escape from the intolerable position of battling against his own people.

And they came out to greet David and to greet the troops who were with him, and David approached with the troops and asked how they fared. And every wicked and worthless man of the men who had gone with David spoke up and said, “In as much as they did not go with us, we will give them nothing from the booty that we rescued, only each man his wife and his children, </a><a href="#bookmark1471" class="s12">that they may drive them </a><a href="#bookmark1472" class="s12">off </a><a href="#bookmark1472" class="s11">and go.” And David said, “You must not do so, my brothers, </a><a href="#bookmark1472" class="s12">with what the L</a><a href="#bookmark1472" class="s14">ORD </a><a href="#bookmark1472" class="s12">has given us</a><a href="#bookmark1472" class="s11">.

At first blush this notice casts a favorable light on the Amalekites in comparison to David, whose practice as a raider has been general massacre of the conquered population. What becomes clear, however, is that the Amalekites (who do not have David’s motive of secrecy) consider the women and children to be part of the booty and have carried them off in order to exploit them as slaves. The appearance of the Egyptian man (verse 11) serves as a reminder of the Amalekites’ role as slaveholders, and of how inhumanely they treat their slaves.</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1433" class="a" name="bookmark1456">they drove them </a>off<span class="p">. This rather brutal verb is typically used for driving animals as in verse 20, and so highlights the rapaciousness of the Amalekites.</span></p><ol id="l87"><li data-list-text="6."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1434" class="a" name="bookmark1457">And David was in dire straits, for the troops thought to stone </a>him<span class="p">. The initial phrase might momentarily be construed as referring to David’s feelings (“and he felt very distressed”), but it is immediately made clear that the reference is to the practical predicament in which he suddenly finds himself in relation to his men. As before, David’s real emotions remain opaque—we know only of his participation in the public orgy of weeping. This moment is also a vivid reminder, as are others in the Saul-David story, of how precarious political power is: David, the charismatic and brilliant commander who has led his men through a host of dangers, suddenly discovers that these hard-bitten warriors are ready to kill him because of the disastrous turn of events. It was he, after all, who drew them to the north with the Philistine army, leaving Ziklag exposed.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1458">&zwnj;</a>David took strength in the Lord his God<span class="p">. He finds encouragement in the face of mortal despair—specifically, as the next verse explains, by calling for the oracle. In this fashion, he staves off the assault his men are contemplating by dramatically showing that they still have means of redress against the Amalekites, and that he has a special channel of communication with God.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="7."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1436" class="a" name="bookmark1459">Bring forth, pray, the </a>ephod<span class="p">. As several interpreters have observed, there is an antithetical contrast here between David, who has priest and ephod to convey to him God’s oracular counsel, and Saul, who, frustrated in all his attempts to discover God’s intentions, resorts to forbidden necromancy.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="8."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1437" class="a" name="bookmark1460">you will surely </a>rescue<span class="p">. The ephod, as we have noted before, can yield only a binary yes-or-no answer, so the gist of the oracle is that David should pursue the raiding party.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But rescuing the captives, which is surely paramount in the minds of the embittered guerilla fighters, was not an explicit part of David’s inquiry of the oracle—perhaps because he was afraid to presume so much. The “yes” from the oracle is now taken to imply that David and his men will both overtake the raiders and rescue their dear ones.</p></li><li data-list-text="9."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1438" class="a" name="bookmark1461">those to be left stayed </a>behind<span class="p">. The first phrase (literally, “the ones being left”) has bothered some commentators, but it is in keeping with occasional biblical usage to introduce this sort of proleptic reference, creating what from a modern point of view is a redundancy between the first and second phrases.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="10."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1462">&zwnj;</a><span class="s20">were . . . exhausted</span>. The verb <i>piger </i>may be related to the noun <i>peger</i>, corpse, and so would have the sense of “dead tired.” It should be kept in mind that David and his men had been traveling three days from the Philistine camp, and now they have had to continue on into the desert at top speed in order to overtake the raiding party.</p></li><li data-list-text="11."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1440" class="a" name="bookmark1463">they found an Egyptian man in the </a>field<span class="p">.

The act of abandoning a sick slave in the desert to perish of thirst and hunger dispels any illusions we may have harbored about the humanity of the Amalekites. Fokkelman has proposed a correspondence (in his calculation, also a synchronicity) between the starving Egyptian and the fasting Saul at Ein-Dor.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="13."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1442" class="a" name="bookmark1465">I am an Egyptian </a><span class="s20">lad</span>.

The presentative “look” (<i>hineh</i>) as an indicator of transition from the narrator’s overview to the character’s point of view has particular tactical importance here. The Amalekites, as we can infer from the fact that four hundred escape the general slaughter, must number well over a thousand. David arrives with only four hundred men. But he finds the raiders entirely vulnerable to a surprise attack—drunk,  sated,  and  sleeping  (rather  like  the  Hessian  mercenaries  whom Washington caught unawares by the Delaware after their Christmas feast). The term rendered as “sprawled out” (<i>netushim</i>) derives from a verbal root that means to abandon or cast away, and so in this context suggests some kind of dissipation. The people who left the Egyptian to starve to death in the desert are now exposed to destruction through their unrestrained indulgence in food and drink.</p></li><li data-list-text="17."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1444" class="a" name="bookmark1467">four hundred </a><span class="s20">lads</span>. Again, the versatile <i>na‘ar </i>is not an indication of chronological age but is used in its military sense, which appears to be something like “elite troops,”</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">or perhaps simply “fighting men.”</p><ol id="l89"><li data-list-text="20."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1445" class="a" name="bookmark1468">They drove before them that </a><span class="s20">livestock</span>. The Masoretic text has the syntactically problematic “before that livestock” (<i>lifney hamiqneh hahu’</i>). This translation is based on a small emendation, <i>lifneyhem </i>(“before them”), assuming a haplography—an inadvertent scribal deletion of repeated letters, since the last two letters of <i>lifneyhem </i>(<i>heh </i>and <i>mem</i>) are also the first two letters of <i>hamiqneh</i>.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1446" class="a" name="bookmark1469">This is David’s </a>booty<span class="p">. Since the Amalekites had been raiding throughout the Negeb, both in Judahite and Philistine territory, they would have assembled a very large collection of plundered flocks. Thus David has abundant livestock to distribute as “gifts”—the word also means “blessing” or “greeting”—to the sundry elders of Judah.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="21."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1447" class="a" name="bookmark1470">he had them </a>stay<span class="p">.

The coarseness of the ill-spirited men is reflected in the verb they use for taking away the wives and children, <i>nahag</i>, which, as we have noted, usually means to drive cattle. (Compare the irate Lot’s use of the same verb in reference to Jacob’s treatment of Rachel and Leah, Genesis 31:26.)</p></li><li data-list-text="23."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1449" class="a" name="bookmark1472">with what the L</a><a href="#bookmark1449" class="s21">ORD </a><a href="#bookmark1449" class="a">has given </a><span class="s20">us</span>. The syntactical link of this clause with what precedes is not entirely clear. Given the ideology of victory that David assumes—all triumph and all spoils of war come from God—it is best to construe the particle ’<i>et </i>that introduces the clause not as a sign of the accusative but as “with.”</p></li><li data-list-text="24."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1450" class="a" name="bookmark1473">who stays with the </a>gear<span class="p">. There is an implicit rationale for giving an equal share to those who remain behind—beyond the consideration of exhaustion, they have played a role in guarding the gear, thus enabling the other fighting men to proceed to battle with a lightened load. It is for this reason that David “had them stay” (or “posted them”) at the ford of the wadi. In all respects, this episode is meant to demonstrate David’s attributes as leader: he finds strength in the face of disaster, consults God’s oracle, intrepidly leads his troops in a counterattack, and now makes the most equitable arrangement for the division of spoils.</span></p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1451" class="s27" name="bookmark1474">26. </a><a href="#bookmark1451" class="a">he sent from the booty to the elders of Judah, to his </a><span class="s20">friends</span>. This act shows David the consummate political man, shoring up support among the sundry leaders of his home tribe of Judah (hence the catalogue of place-names), and preparing for himself a base in Hebron (at the end of the catalogue), the principal town of Judah, where he will soon be proclaimed king. Some scholars have been troubled by “to his friends” (<i>lerei‘eihu</i>, which would normally mean “to his friend”) and have sought to emend it. Kimchi, however, persuasively argues that the ostensibly singular noun can be legitimately read as a plural on the basis of other biblical precedents, and that the reference to “friends” makes good political sense: these are the same elders of Judah who provided cover for David during the period when he was hiding out from Saul in</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">his own tribal territory. The verb “move about” (<i>hithalekh</i>) in the wrap-up verse of this section is an allusion to precisely this period, for it recalls David’s flight with his men from Saul at Keilah in 23:13—“and they moved about wherever they could.”</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">CHAPTER 31</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1489" class="s28" name="bookmark1475">A</a><a href="#bookmark1489" class="s5">nd meanwhile the Philistines were </a>battling <a href="#bookmark1491" class="s6">against Israel, and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and they fell slain on Mount Gilboa.

The Hebrew does not explicitly say “meanwhile,” but it is implied by the unusual use of the participial form of the verb (literally, “are battling”) to begin the narrative unit.

It has been argued that the duplication reflects a conflation of two textual variants, but it may be that the writer intended to highlight the use of the bow, in contrast to other weapons. In characteristics biblical fashion, the narrative offers no details of the battle, but the following broad outline can be reconstructed: The major engagement of forces takes place in the Jezreel Valley, to the northwest of Mount Gilboa. The level ground of the valley would have given the Philistines the opportunity to deploy their iron chariots, one of their great strategic advantages over the Israelites. In the rout of the Israelites that ensues, Saul’s forces retreat to the high ground of Mount Gilboa, where the Philistine chariots would have greater difficulty maneuvering. But the Philistines send contingents of archers—the bow being the ideal weapon to use against an army in flight—who exact heavy casualties from the Israelite forces.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1477" class="a" name="bookmark1491">he quaked with </a>fear<span class="p">. A revocalization of the verb favored by many scholars yields “he was badly wounded.” But there is much to be said for the Masoretic vocalization: Saul’s fear has been a recurring theme in the narrative; here it would be matched by the armor bearer’s great fear of violating the king; and it is far from clear that Saul is seriously wounded when he decides to commit suicide (if he were, would he have the strength to fling himself on his sword?).</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1478" class="s27" name="bookmark1492">4. </a><a href="#bookmark1478" class="a">and abuse </a>me<span class="p">. Like the urgent request of the dying Abimelech in Judges 9, with whom the dying Saul has sometimes been compared, Saul’s last wish will be denied him—the Philistines, though deprived of the opportunity to kill him, will decapitate his body and defile it by hammering it up on the wall of Beth-Shan.</span></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1479" class="s27" name="bookmark1493">6. </a><a href="#bookmark1479" class="a">and all his men as </a><span style=" color: #00F;">well</span><span class="p">. The parallel texts in both 1 Chronicles 10 and in the Septuagint lack this phrase.

Saul’s successor David had marked his entry on the scene by cutting off the head of a Philistine; now they cut off Saul’s head. The stripping of the armor—and the all-purpose Hebrew <i>kelim </i>could also include his clothing—is the final divestment of Saul, who is stripped before the prophets, stripped of his royal garments at Ein-Dor, and now lies naked on the battlefield in ultimate defeat.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1482" class="a" name="bookmark1496">they sent throughout the Philistine </a>country<span class="p">.

Throughout  the  ancient Mediterranean world, there was a horror about leaving a corpse unburied (compare, for example, the potency of this question in Sophocles’ <i>Antigone</i>).

Does one accidentally stumble onto a battlefield while the killing is still going on? A more likely scenario is that the Amalekite came onto the battlefield immediately after the fighting as a scavenger, found Saul’s corpse before the Philistines did, and removed the regalia.</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1508" class="a" name="bookmark1537">Saul was leaning on his </a>spear<span class="p">.

Only now, in the middle of the story, is the national identity of the messenger revealed. The fact that he was an Amalekite means he would have felt no recoil of taboo about doing violence to the king of Israel—something Saul appears to grasp at once. (Compare Doeg the Edomite’s slaughter of the priests of Nob in 1 Samuel 22.) But there is also dramatic irony here: Saul lost his hold on the kingship when he failed to kill the Amalekite king; now he begs an Amalekite to kill him, the king of Israel.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="9."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1510" class="a" name="bookmark1539">Pray, stand over me and finish me </a><span class="s20">off</span>. “Stand over” suggests that Saul himself is barely standing, that he is collapsed against the support of his spear—the very spear that has been associated with his kingship and with his outbursts of rage. “Finish me off” is somewhat inelegant as English diction, but the nuance of the Hebrew (the <i>polel </i>conjugation of the verbal stem that means “to die”) is essential to the story: Saul feels he is dying, and he asks the Amalekite lad not to kill him but to finish him off before the Philistines can get to him. The Amalekite and David concur in this indication of what the Amalekite does to Saul.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1540">&zwnj;</a>the fainting spell<span class="p">.

This clause, which has vexed some critics and has led to emendations, is most simply construed as a broken-off sentence that the failing Saul does not have the strength to complete.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="10."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1513" class="a" name="bookmark1542">I stood over him and finished him </a>off<span class="p">. This whole story obviously contradicts the account of Saul’s death by his own hand in 1 Samuel 31. Predictably, this has led many critics to imagine two conflicting “sources.” It is reassuring that more recent scholarly consensus has come to the sensible conclusion that the Amalekite lad is lying. Having</span></p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">come upon Saul’s body, he sees a great opportunity for himself: he will bring Saul’s regalia to David, claim personally to have finished off the man known to be David’s archenemy  and  rival,  and  thereby  overcome  his  marginality  as  resident  alien (“sojourner,” <i>ger</i>) by receiving a benefaction from the new king—perhaps a portion of land at David’s disposal. Fokkelman shrewdly notes that the Amalekite, instead of removing the diadem and armband from Saul’s body, might better have buried the body or dragged it off and so saved it from desecration by the Philistines.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1514" class="a" name="bookmark1543">for I knew that he could not live after having </a>fallen<span class="p">. The Amalekite sees Saul’s condition “leaning” on his spear to be equivalent to having fallen (“for the fainting spell has seized me”) and assumes, as does Saul himself in this account, that in any case the king will not survive.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="14."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1515" class="a" name="bookmark1544">How were you not afraid . . . to do violence to the L</a><a href="#bookmark1515" class="s21">ORD</a><a href="#bookmark1515" class="a">’</a><a href="#bookmark1515" class="s21">S </a><span class="s20">anointed? </span>Though the Israelite piety of David’s statement is noteworthy, his words, as in the previous episodes in which he warned against harming Saul, are also politically self-interested because he, too, is the L<span class="s22">ORD</span>’<span class="s22">S </span>anointed.

There is no way of knowing whether David actually believes the Amalekite’s story, but it is certainly convenient for him to be able to point an accusing finger at someone with whom he has had nothing to do as the person responsible for Saul’s death, and then to order immediate punishment.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1517" class="a" name="bookmark1546">the L</a><a href="#bookmark1517" class="s21">ORD</a><a href="#bookmark1517" class="a">’</a><a href="#bookmark1517" class="s21">S </a>anointed<span class="p">.

We have been aware since 1 Samuel 16 of David’s gift as a lyre player and (presumably) as a singer. Only now do we hear him in action as a singer-poet. This grandly resonant lament, cast in archaic epic diction, marks a great moment of transition in the larger narrative, as the David-Saul story becomes the David story. It is also another public utterance of David’s that beautifully serves his political purposes, celebrating his dead rival as it mourns his loss and thus testifying that David could never have desired Saul’s death.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="18."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1519" class="a" name="bookmark1548">to teach hard </a><span class="s20">things</span>. The Masoretic text has “to teach the bow”—a problematic reading because the lament scarcely provides instruction in the arts of war. Some critics delete “bow” (<i>qeshet</i>), following the Septuagint.

As Shimon Bar-Efrat has observed, apostrophe is the dominant form of address throughout the elegy. David first turns, in a plural verb, to Israel at large (“Tell it not in Gath”), then to the hills of Gilboa, then to Saul and Jonathan, then to the daughters of Israel, then to Jonathan alone. The apostrophe is a form of address that underscores the actual absence of the person or object addressed and so is especially apt for an elegy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1553">&zwnj;</a><span class="s20">lofty fields</span>. The Hebrew <i>usedeh terumot </i>is a little obscure. The simplest solution is to treat the initial particle <i>u </i>as an excrescence and to read the phrase as a poetic inversion of the similar <i>meromey sadeh </i>in Judges 5:18. In the parallelism here, “lofty fields” would be an epithet for “hills of Gilboa.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1525" class="a" name="bookmark1554">unburnished with </a><span class="s20">oil</span>.

This disposition, however, tells us little about David’s sexual orientation. The bond between men in this warrior culture could easily be stronger than the bond between men and women.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1531" class="s27" name="bookmark1560">27. </a><a href="#bookmark1531" class="a">How have the warriors fallen, / and the gear of battle is </a>lost<span class="p">. The first clause here echoes the second verset of the opening line of the poem and so closes the elegy in a ringing envelope structure. The second clause beautifully picks up the image of the castoff shield lying in the dust, and of the relentless bow and sword that will never more be borne into battle. It is misguided to render the verb at the end as “perished” (King James Version, New Jewish Publication Society) because that presupposes that “gear of battle” is actually an epithet for Saul and Jonathan. Far more effectively, the lament concludes with a concrete image of shield and sword and bow abandoned, and by a simple process of metonymy we vividly understand the fate of the two men who once wielded them.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">CHAPTER 2</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1561">&zwnj;</a><span class="s3">A</span><a href="#bookmark1590" class="s6">nd it happened afterward that </a><a href="#bookmark1590" class="s5">David inquired of the L</a><span class="s29">ORD</span><a href="#bookmark1591" class="s6">, saying, “Shall I </a><a href="#bookmark1591" class="s5">go up into one of the towns of </a>Judah<span style=" color: #000;">?” And the L</span><span class="s8">ORD </span><a href="#bookmark1592" class="s6">said to him, “Go up.” And David said, “</a><a href="#bookmark1592" class="s5">Where shall I go </a>up<a href="#bookmark1593" class="s6">?” And He said, “To Hebron.” And David went up there, and his two wives as well, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

It is a little odd for a single tribe to have a “king,” but the act is deliberately presumptive on David’s part—first the king of Judah, eventually of all the tribes. Saul’s son Ish-Bosheth, by contrast, becomes king of an alliance of northern tribes. The text is silent on the Philistines’ view of David’s move to kingship in Hebron, but one can assume they countenanced it as a reasonable act on the part of their vassal opposing the house of Saul.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1565" class="s27" name="bookmark1594">5. </a><a href="#bookmark1565" class="a">David sent messengers to the men of </a>Jabesh-Gilead<span class="p">.

Abner the commander in chief is clearly the real power here, and this surviving son of Saul is little more than a puppet king. The original name (reflected in Chronicles) was Ish-Baal, with the “baal” component being a general epithet for God (or god), not necessarily referring to the Canaanite deity. But because of its pagan associations, the sternly monotheistic later editors systematically substituted <i>boshet </i>for <i>ba‘al, boshet </i>meaning “shame.”</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1597">&zwnj;</a>Mahanaim<span class="p">.

Shimon Bar-Efrat has made the plausible proposal that this final phrase is not a summary of the preceding list but the last stage in a chronological process: Ish-Bosheth extended his rule gradually, beginning with Gilead in trans-Jordan and moving westward into the territory the Philistines had conquered.

The “lads” (<i>ne ‘arim</i>) are elite warriors. The verb “play” clearly indicates gladiatorial, or representative, combat.

Throughout this strange episode, as Polzin has aptly observed, there is an “extended ritualization of action as it is described through extensive stylization of language.” The ritual combat is virtually an allegory of the civil war that it inaugurates. (Polzin reads it as an allegory of Israelite monarchy.) The twelve champions on each side recall the twelve tribes of Israel—an image of a nation destructively divided against itself. (The number of fallen soldiers on Abner’s side will be 360—thirty times twelve—and on Joab’s side twenty, an eighteenth part of the other side’s casualties.) The implausibility of the account of combat, then, would have been overridden for the writer by the neatness of its symbolic function.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="16."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1575" class="a" name="bookmark1604">each man grasped the head of the other with his sword at the side of the </a>other<span class="p">. The evidence of artifacts from the ancient world suggests that precisely this mode of ritualized  combat  was  quite  widespread.

The Masoretic text has “had you not spoken.” This has led some interpreters to construe “morning” as “tomorrow morning” (that is, the troops would have gone on pursuing you all night long had you not spoken up now). But this is strained because the Hebrew ’<i>az mehaboker </i>(literally, “then from the morning”) idiomatically refers to the morning of the day on which one is speaking. One should either emend “had not” (<i>lulei’</i>) to “had” (<i>lu</i>) or, as Rashi proposed long ago, construe the former in the sense of the latter.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1587" class="s27" name="bookmark1616">29. </a>the Arabah<span class="p">.

Geshur is a small trans-Jordanian kingdom at the foot of the Golan. The marriage is clearly a political act through which David establishes an alliance in the north, outflanking the house of Saul.

It is a little odd that only she is so designated. This might be because she stands at the end of the list, or because there was knowledge of another Eglah who was not David’s wife.

This is the same verb, in a different conjugation, as in the opening verse of the chapter, which reported David’s growing strength and the weakening of the house of Saul. As the Saulide forces are progressively harder pressed in the continuing war, the nominal king becomes more and more dependent on his military commander; and Abner, while not actually pretending to the throne, arrogates more and more power to himself.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="7."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1625" class="a" name="bookmark1662">Why did you come to bed with my father’s </a><span class="s20">concubine? </span>This crucial act is elided in the narrative report and revealed only in Ish-Bosheth’s indignant question. To take sexual possession of a king’s consort was to make an implicit claim to the power he exercised, as we shall see again when Absalom publicly cohabits with David’s concubines. “To come to bed with”—literally, “to come into”—is an idiom for sexual intercourse that generally indicates sexual possession of a woman with whom a man has not been previously intimate. (I explain the semantic logic of the idiom in my commentary on Genesis. <i>The Five Books of Moses</i>, page 39).</p></li><li data-list-text="8."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1663">&zwnj;</a>Am I a dog’s head attached to Judah? <span class="p">The dog in biblical idiom regularly figures as a contemptible beast—the antonym of the fierce and regal lion.

You are entirely dependent on my loyal support, he tells Ish-Bosheth, so how could you dare object to so trivial a thing as my taking a particular woman as sexual partner? Alternately, the implication could be: you are entirely dependent on me, so how could you object to my taking possession of this sexual symbol of political power?

Ish-Bosheth’s protest about Rizpah drives Abner, David’s military adversary, to embrace the notion that God has promised the throne to David. Rather than continue to serve a carping, pusillanimous man like Ish- Bosheth, who neither fully accepts Abner’s power nor knows how to exercise power on his own, Abner now is ready to throw his weight with a truly kingly leader and to help him become king over all the nation’s tribes (verse 10).</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1629" class="s27" name="bookmark1666">11. </a><a href="#bookmark1629" class="a">he could say back not a </a>word<span class="p">.

The first marriage buttresses David’s claim to reign over all Israel, including the tribe of Benjamin. That is why he identifies Michal to Abner as Saul’s daughter.

There is scarcely a more striking instance of the evocative compactness of biblical narrative. We know almost nothing about Paltiel. He speaks not a word of dialogue. Yet his walking after Michal, weeping all the while, intimates a devoted love that stands in contrast to David’s relationship with her. Paltiel is a man whose fate is imposed on him. Michal was given to him by Saul, evidently without his initiative. He came to love her. Now he must give her up, and confronted by Saul’s strongman with the peremptory order to go back, he has no choice but to go back.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="17."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1673">&zwnj;</a><span class="s20">Time and again in the past</span>. The idiom for “times gone by,” <i>temol shilshom </i>(literally, “yesterday and the day before”) is reinforced by the emphatic adverb <i>gam</i>, repeated before each of the two components of the idiom, probably as an indication of repeated acts in times past. Most commentators refer the idea of Israel’s wanting David as king to his immense popularity during his early military successes (1 Samuel 18). But there was no intimation then that the people wanted to replace Saul with David on the throne. The suggestion of repeated popular support for David’s claims might well point to an otherwise unreported undercurrent of dissatisfaction with the house of Saul and an interest in going over to David as a result of the losing civil war, if it is not Abner’s own diplomatic invention.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1637" class="s27" name="bookmark1674">21. </a><a href="#bookmark1637" class="a">And David sent Abner off, and he went in </a><span class="s20">peace</span>. The going in peace befits the feast of reconciliation and the agreed-on pact. The writer contrives to repeat this sentence verbatim three times (here, verse 22, verse 23). But when Joab refers to this very same departure of Abner from Hebron in verse 24, he substitutes for “in peace” (<i>beshalom</i>) the emphatic infinitive <i>halokh </i>(“going off”). This ominous substitution, as I put it in <i>The Art of Biblical Narrative</i>, “falls like the clatter of a dagger after the ringing of bells”—especially because “to go” sometimes occurs in the Bible as a euphemism for dying (see Job 27:21 and Jeremiah 22:10). Polzin has noted that this entire episode is a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">crowded juncture of comings and goings. The least complicated inference to be drawn from that fact is that this is a crucial moment of transition in the David story: the house of Saul comes to treat with the house of David; the long conflict with Saul, culminating in civil war, comes to an end; David is about to become king of the whole Israelite nation; a new line of division now emerges between David and his chief henchman, Joab. All this flurry of transition and realignment is nicely caught in the multiple comings and goings of Abner and Joab and the troops.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1638" class="s27" name="bookmark1675">24. </a><a href="#bookmark1638" class="a">Look, Abner has come to </a><span class="s20">you</span>. The simple idiom for arrival (<i>ba’ ’el</i>) ironically echoes Ish-Bosheth’s use of the very same idiom in its sexual sense (“come into,” “come to bed with”) in his complaint to Abner. The sexual undertone is sustained in the next verse because the prominent verb “to dupe” (<i>pitah</i>) has the primary meaning of “seduce.”</p><ol id="l102"><li data-list-text="26."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1676">&zwnj;</a>the cistern of Sirah<span class="p">.

The Qumran Samuel text puts a full stop after “before the L<span class="s22">ORD </span>for all time,” then makes this phrase the subject of the next clause: “May the blood of Abner son of Ner come down on the head of Joab.” The Masoretic text has simply “May it come down on the head of Joab,” and this translation supplies “blood guilt” (plural of <i>dam</i>, blood) for the sake of clarity.</p></li><li data-list-text="29."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1646" class="a" name="bookmark1683">discharge from his </a><span class="s20">member</span>.

Some prefer to interpret the Hebrew term as “crutch,” thus linking it with the two preceding images of disease. This noun, <i>pelekh</i>, occurs quite infrequently, but there is scant indication in the biblical corpus that as a wooden implement it meant anything but “spindle.” The word “woman’s” is added in the translation to catch the nuance of scorn in a man’s being reduced to woman’s work. All in all, David puts together a first-class curse to emphasize the distance between him and Abner’s killer. This blood guilt, many times compounded, will indeed come down on Joab’s head, but not till the end of David’s life.</p></li><li data-list-text="30."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1649" class="a" name="bookmark1686">had lain in wait for </a><span class="s20">Abner</span>.

David’s plight as a self-proclaimed “gentle” or “tender” man (<i>rakh</i>) vis-à-vis the “hard” sons of Zeruiah will continue to play a crucial role in the story. But though he dissociates himself from Joab and Abishai and goes so far as to pronounce a scathing curse on them and their descendants, he makes no move to get rid of them, and continues to depend on their activity as strongmen. And what of Joab’s  reaction  to  all  this  bitter  denunciation?  Is  it  possible  that  he  prudently understands it is politic for the king to dissociate himself from the killing by denouncing the killers in poetry and prose? There is also a question here about the relation between the two phrases David uses. Many translations explain the link as “though anointed king.” That construction is possible, though it would be an unusual use of the Hebrew particle <i>we </i>(“and”). The present translation adds “just,” on the assumption that David is dramatizing his predicament as a gentle person on whom the kingship has been newly thrust and who must contend with these hard sons of Zeruiah. In point of fact, he was anointed in Hebron several years earlier, but this might be either rhetorical exaggeration or a reference to his brand-new condition of king of the nation, not just of the tribe of Judah.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">CHAPTER 4</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1705" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 30pt;" name="bookmark1693">A</a><a href="#bookmark1704" class="s6">nd </a><a href="#bookmark1704" class="s5">the son of </a><a href="#bookmark1705" class="s5">Saul </a><a href="#bookmark1705" class="s6">heard that Abner had died in Hebron, and he </a><a href="#bookmark1705" class="s5">was utterly shaken</a><a href="#bookmark1705" class="s6">, and all Israel was dismayed.

Either this detail has been elided in the dialogue reported for Baanah and Rechab when they come before David, or he has received advance word of the killing and its circumstances from another source. In all this, the common scholarly view is that the narrative is framed as an apology for David, taking pains to clear him of any complicity in the deaths, first of Saul, then of Abner, and now of Ish-Bosheth. But it is still more plausible that the writer is continuing his representation of David as the consummately politic man: whether he really feels moral revulsion against these assassins we have no way of knowing, but he surely is aware, as he was after the murder of Abner, that it is in his political interest to put the greatest possible distance between himself and the killers of Saul’s son, and what better way to do this than to have them executed on the spot? David is nevertheless a beneficiary of the murder, for now there is no claimant to the throne whom the northern tribes might follow instead of him.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="12."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1715">&zwnj;</a>chopped off their hands and feet<span class="p">. The dismembering of malefactors or prisoners was a common ancient Near Eastern practice, as we have seen before (and compare the first chapter of Judges).

The whole episode ends in a strange image cluster of detached body parts: the hands and feet of the two executed assassins and the head of their victim.

It is </a>you<span class="p">. The language of the tribal representatives puts considerable emphasis on the second-person pronoun: you are the one that we, and God, have chosen.

This is not a duplication of the report in verse 1 from another source, as is often claimed. The convention used here is the well- attested one of “resumptive repetition”: when an interrupted narrative strand is resumed, a phrase from the point of interruption is repeated verbatim to mark the return to the main line. Here, the move to confirm David as king of Israel, with which the episode began, after the insertion of the tribes’ dialogue (verses 1 and 2), is carried forward. It is the role of the tribal rank and file to proclaim fealty, but of the elders to sign a pact and anoint David, and so “elders” is now strategically substituted for “tribes” of the first</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">verse. One should note that the tribes come “to David” whereas the elders come “to the king,” for they are about to consummate the official business of kingmaking.</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1719" class="a" name="bookmark1736">forty years he was </a>king<span class="p">. In biblical usage, this is a formulaic number—in Judges often used to indicate a full term of governing. But the specificity of “seven years and six months” in Hebron has the look of a real number, whether or not it is historically precise.</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1720" class="s27" name="bookmark1737">6. </a><a href="#bookmark1720" class="a">the king went . . . to </a>Jerusalem<span class="p">. The chronological link between this action and what precedes, as well as the chronology of the subsequent events in the chapter, is not clear. The principle of organization appears to be thematic or ideological rather than temporal. What we have here is a catalogue of salient actions by which David consolidates his new monarchy: the conquest of a capital city in the center of the north-south axis of the country that does not belong to any tribal territory (the same logic that led to the creation of Washington as capital in the District of Columbia, not part of any state); the construction of a palace with the assistance of a Phoenician alliance; the begetting of many offspring, including the future heir to the throne, Solomon; the defeat of the Philistines. The birth of Solomon is the clearest indication that these notices do not follow the chronology of the preceding narrative.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1721" class="a" name="bookmark1738">the blind and the </a><span class="s20">lame</span>. This puzzling phrase, together with its even more enigmatic occurrence in verse 8, is a notorious crux. The most disparate theories have been proposed for how to read the words of the text and how to reconstruct what is said to go on in the conquest of the city. The Qumran Samuel scroll for this verse reads: “You shall not enter here, for the blind and the lame have incited <i>[hesitu </i>for Masoretic <i>hesirkha</i>], saying, ‘David shall not enter here.’” This variant has the advantage of fluency, but one suspects it may have been invented to make a difficult traditional text more intelligible. The explanation proposed by Yigal Yadin is probably the most plausible: he points to a Hittite text for the swearing in of troops in which a blind woman and a lame man are set before the men with the monitory imprecation that their fate will be like that of those wretches if they fail in their duty. The Jebusites, then, might have displayed the lame and the blind on the ramparts with an analogous curse against those who would presume to attack the city. This taunting curse would explain why these maimed figures are “despised by David.”</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1722" class="s27" name="bookmark1739">8. </a><a href="#bookmark1722" class="a">Whoever strikes down the Jebusite and reaches the </a><span class="s20">conduit</span>. These words are the other salient element of the crux, with debate still raging over the meaning of “conduit” (<i>tsinor</i>). Some scholars have claimed it refers here to the windpipe, or a lower part of the anatomy, of the Jebusites who are to be struck down, but there is no Hebrew evidence for <i>tsinor </i>as anything but a water channel or tube, and the argument from the analogy of shape is a weak one. Moreover, the verb used here, <i>naga‘</i>, means primarily “to touch,” and in some biblical contexts, “to reach” or “take charge of” but not “to strike.” The most likely reference, then, is to a daring route of surprise access into the city. A frequently proposed candidate is Warren’s Shaft, discovered in 1867, an</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">underground tunnel feeding in from the Gihon Spring on a slope outside the wall to the east. Though everything about this report remains uncertain, David may be saying that whoever manages to crawl through the tunnel, make his way up the vertical shaft that transects it, and cut down the Jebusites within the town together with their loathsome display of lame and blind will be given a great reward. (The reward clause is missing; one is supplied in the parallel verse in Chronicles—“will become a chief and commander.”)</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1724" class="a" name="bookmark1740">No blind man nor lame shall enter the </a>House<span class="p">. The story is thus given an etiological turn as an explanation for a known taboo, evidently pertaining to the temple but perhaps to David’s “house” (that is, the palace). One wonders whether there is an invitation here to think of Jonathan’s lame son—which would be another gesture for denying the Saulides all future claim to the throne.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1725" class="s27" name="bookmark1741">11. </a><a href="#bookmark1725" class="a">Hiram king of </a>Tyre<span class="p">. Hiram as a provider of timber and artisans points forward to Solomon’s construction of the temple. If this is the Hiram with whom Solomon had dealings, David’s palace building would have been undertaken rather late in his own reign in order to coincide with Hiram’s regnal span.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1726" class="s27" name="bookmark1742">13. </a>from Jerusalem<span class="p">.

David’s assumption of the throne of all the tribes of Israel means that he has decisively cast aside his vassal status, and so the Philistines, who all along have been warring with the northern tribes, assemble their united forces (“all the Philistines”) to suppress the new monarchy.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1723" class="a" name="bookmark1744">the </a>stronghold<span class="p">. The claim often made that this refers to the stronghold at Adullam (compare 1 Samuel 22) is unlikely because the battle here is entirely in the immediate vicinity of Jerusalem. This would have to be the stronghold within the city, referred to in verse 9. David can “go down” to it because his residence in Jerusalem could be topographically above the stronghold.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1728" class="s27" name="bookmark1745">18. </a>the Valley of Rephaim<span class="p">.

The existing place-name is etiologically reinscribed to fit the military victory.

This is an archaic story that defies later ethical categories: The Ark, as God’s terrestrial throne, is invested with awesome divine power (compare 1 Samuel 6). To touch it, even in an effort to keep it from slipping off the cart, is to risk being consumed by its indwelling mana, as when one comes in contact with a high-voltage electric core. God’s wrath against Uzzah triggers an answering wrath (the same verb in the Hebrew) on the part of David, frustrated in his purposes and now wondering whether he will ever manage to bring this symbol and earthly focus of God’s power to his newly conquered capital.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1757" class="a" name="bookmark1777">for reaching out his hand to the </a><span class="s20">Ark</span>.

Some construe this as an imperfect verb: with every six steps David would sacrifice a bull. Apart from the difficulty that these constant sacrifices would make the procession interminable and require scores of thousands of bulls, the imperfect would require the verb “to be” at the beginning of the sentence to appear in the suffix conjugation <i>wehayah</i>, instead of the way it is, in the prefix conjugation, <i>wayehi</i>, which implies a singulative, not an iterative, tense for the verb.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1761" class="s27" name="bookmark1781">14. </a><a href="#bookmark1761" class="a">girt in a linen </a>ephod<span class="p">. The wearing of the ephod surely underscores the fact that in the procession of the Ark into Jerusalem, David is playing the roles of both priest and king—a double service not unknown in the ancient Near East (compare Melchisedek in Genesis 14). The ephod was probably a short garment tied around the hips or waist, and so David whirling and leaping might easily have exposed himself, as Michal will bitterly observe.</span></p><ol id="l109"><li data-list-text="16."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1762" class="a" name="bookmark1782">Michal daughter of Saul looked out through the window and saw King </a>David<span class="p">. The preceding verse reports the shouts of jubilation and the shrill blasts of the ram’s horn: first she hears the procession approaching from the distance, then she looks out and sees David dancing. Strategically, her repeated epithet in this episode of final estrangement is “daughter of Saul,” not “wife of David,” and the figure she sees is not “David her husband” but “King David.” Shimon Bar-Efrat neatly observes that at the beginning of their story a loving Michal helped David escape “through the window” from her father’s henchmen while now she looks at him from a distance “through the window,” in seething contempt.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="17."><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1763" class="s27" name="bookmark1783">–20. </a><a href="#bookmark1763" class="s24">Instead of proceeding </a>directly <span style=" color: #000;">to the confrontation between Michal and David, as we might expect, the narrative lingers for a long moment over David’s cultic ministrations and royal benefactions to the people.

Astoundingly, until this climactic moment, there has been no dialogue between Michal and David—only her urgent instructions for him to flee in 1 Samuel 19 and his silent flight. We can only guess what she may have felt all those years he was away from her, acquiring power and wives, or during the civil war with her father’s family. We are equally ignorant of her feelings toward her devoted second husband, Paltiel son of Laish. Now the royal couple are finally represented meeting, and when Michal speaks out, it is in an explosion of angry sarcasm. Her first significant word “honored” (balanced in David’s rejoinder by two antonyms, “dishonored” and “debased”) is a complex satellite to the story of the grand entry of the Ark with which it is linked. When the Ark was lost to the Philistines (1 Samuel 4), the great cry was that “glory [or, honor, <i>kavod—</i>the same verbal root Michal uses here] was exiled from Israel.” Now glory/honor splendidly returns to Israel, but the actual invocation of the term is a sarcastic one, bitterly directed at David, who will then hurl back two antonyms and try to redefine both honor and dishonor to his wife. The logic of the larger story’s moral and historical realism requires that no triumph should be simple and unambiguous, that strife and accusation pursue even the fulfillment of national destiny. One should also note here that Michal speaks to her husband in the third person, not deferentially but angrily, and refers to him by public title, not in any personal relation to her.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1766" class="a" name="bookmark1786">who has exposed himself today to the eyes of his servants’ </a>slavegirls<span class="p">. The verb “to expose” is clearly used in the sexual sense. The proud Michal’s reference to the lowly slavegirls’ enjoying the sight of David’s nakedness probably suggests an edge of sexual jealousy as well as political resentment in her rage against him. He has, after all,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">assembled a harem during their years apart, and there is no indication that he has resumed sexual relations with her after having her brought back to him forcibly for obviously political motives.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1787">&zwnj;</a>as some scurrilous fellow would expose himself<span class="p">.

Isaac Abravanel, the Hebrew commentator who was also Ferdinand and Isabella’s financial advisor until the expulsion of 1492, aptly explains this: “Had he danced before some person to honor him, it would have been a contemptible act, for his status was higher than any other person’s. But in his leaping before the L<span class="s22">ORD </span>there is no cause for contempt.” Thus David can go on to say that he will perform ostensibly debasing acts, even debasing in his own eyes (emending this to “His eyes” only clouds matters), acts that in paradoxical fact are the opposite of debasement.</p></li><li data-list-text="22."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1768" class="a" name="bookmark1789">with the slavegirls . . . with them let me be </a>honored<span class="p">. David flings back Michal’s sarcastic “how honored,” suggesting that, unlike Michal, the simple slavegirls will understand that his gyrations before the Ark are an act of reverence and will honor him for it.

This transitional note establishes a link with the previous episode, in which David brought the Ark into Jerusalem and had his final confrontation with Michal, which in a sense was the final blow to the house of Saul. What follows is a major caesura in the David story—a long pause marked by ideological reflections on the future, before David must deal once again with external enemies and then be engulfed by internecine strife in his court. The language of both Nathan’s night vision and David’s prayer is strikingly different from that of the surrounding narrative—more hortatory, more formulaic, more reminiscent of the Deuteronomistic school that would come to dominate Israel’s national literature nearly four centuries after the reign of David. The literary archeology that has been performed on these two long passages remains in contention, some scholars claiming these are late compositions of a Deuteronomistic writer, others arguing that two or more authentically old literary strata have been joined together and framed by a later editor.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">These are not issues that it will be useful to attempt to resolve here. What is worth noting is the deliberate structural separation effected by these two passages between everything that precedes the ensconcing of throne and Ark in Jerusalem and everything that follows.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1792" class="a" name="bookmark1814">respite . . . from his </a>enemies<span class="p">.

This is not, as some interpreters have claimed, the expression of a pre-Solomonic antitemple ideology. The author of this episode is faced with the difficulty of explaining a historical fact, that David did not build the temple, as we might have expected, but rather it was his son Solomon who carried out the construction. The probable historical reason was that David was too preoccupied with the struggles within his own court and family. In Chronicles, the reason given is that he had shed blood. Here, the argument God makes is that it is an act of presumption for a mere mortal to build a temple for the unhoused God of Israelite history. But this line of reasoning actually enhances the theological importance of Solomon’s temple, for it suggests that God Himself will build a house when He is good and ready, using the human agency He chooses. Thus the temple that is to be raised up by David’s seed will have a more than human importance, being at once a token of God’s indwelling among His people Israel and a divine underwriting of the Davidic dynasty.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1799" class="a" name="bookmark1821">in tent and </a>tabernacle<span class="p">.

Both in this prophecy and in David’s prayer the double meaning of “house” is repeatedly exploited.

The house in which David dwells in the opening verse of this chapter is of course his palace in Jerusalem.</span></p></li></ol><ol id="l114"><li data-list-text="14."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1824">&zwnj;</a>the rod men use . . . the afflictions of humankind<span class="p">.

Although the thread of piety in David’s complex and contradictory character could be perfectly authentic, he does not elsewhere speak in this elevated, liturgical, celebratory style, and so the inference of the presence of another writer in this passage is plausible.

This characteristically vague temporal reference actually reflects the achronological arrangement of the narrative material at this point. Chapter 7 was a long pause in the progress of the larger story that was devoted to the theological grounds for the postponement of building a temple and to the promise of a perpetual Davidic dynasty. Chapter 8 offers a summary of David’s conquests (which in historical fact would have spanned at least several years) resulting in the establishment of a small empire. We then revert to the intimate story of David.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1835" class="a" name="bookmark1855">David struck down the Philistines and subjugated </a>them<span class="p">. Neither the Hebrew terms of the text nor the scant extrabiblical evidence allow one to conclude whether David actually occupied the Philistine cities on the coastal plain or merely reduced them to vassal status. In any case, he put an end to the Philistine military threat and was free to turn his attention to adversaries east of the Jordan.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1856">&zwnj;</a><span class="s20">Metheg-Ammah</span>.

It should be recalled that Moab, with whom David is linked by ancestry, provided refuge for his parents from Saul. Perhaps now that David has consolidated an Israelite monarchy, each side views the other as a threat.

Presumably, the absence of the king from the Aramean heartland exposed it to David’s attack. The term <i>yad </i>here (usually “hand”) is construed in its occasional sense of monument or stele, though the idiom <i>heshiv yad </i>(literally, “to bring back the hand”) also has the sense of “strike.” Were that the case here, however, one would probably expect an object to the striking (“brought his hand back against X.”).</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1841" class="a" name="bookmark1861">one thousand seven hundred </a>horsemen<span class="p">.

The most likely explanation for this cruel act is that the Israelites, who initially fought on mountainous terrain, as yet made no significant use of cavalry, and so David’s only concern would be to disable the horses in order that they could not be used against him in the future. The hundred horses left unmaimed might perhaps be for use as a small experiment with cavalry, or as draft animals.</span></p><ol id="l116"><li data-list-text="7."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1843" class="a" name="bookmark1863">the golden </a><span class="s20">quivers</span>.

Sending the prince as emissary is a token of the importance that the king attaches to the mission. The vessels of precious metals are a peace offering to David or, from another perspective, an advance payment of tribute.

We are immediately alerted to the fact that we are returning from the chronicle summary of Chapter 8 (where there is no dialogue) and from the long set speeches of Chapter 7 to the main body of the David story because once again the narrative is carried forward to a large extent by dialogue.

The courtiers who are queried evidently don’t know, so they propose summoning a retainer of Saul’s in order to put the question to him. The fact that David is later complicit in the execution of seven men of the house of Saul (Chapter 21) has led many analysts to conclude that the original place of that episode was before the present chapter. Polzin, on the other hand, argues that the postponement of the report in Chapter 21 is deliberately delayed exposition, meant to reveal another troubling facet of David near the end of his story.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1876" class="s27" name="bookmark1889">3. </a><a href="#bookmark1876" class="a">keep God’s </a><span class="s20">faith</span>. The “faith” in question (<span class="s26">ḥ</span><i>esed</i>) is not credal but faithful performance of one’s obligation in a covenant, a term that also has the connotation of “kindness.” “God” here has the force of an intensifier. The covenant that is explicitly alluded to is the one between Jonathan and David (1 Samuel 20:42). That tight link is one of several arguments against the view widely held ever since the 1926 study of Leonhard Rost that this episode marks the beginning of a wholly independent Succession Narrative, which continues till 1 Kings 2.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1877" class="a" name="bookmark1890">who is </a>crippled<span class="p">. Ziba’s mention of the surviving Saulide’s handicap is probably intended to assure David that Mephibosheth will not pose any challenge to the throne.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1878" class="s27" name="bookmark1891">4. </a>Lo-Debar<span class="p">. Mephibosheth was evidently taken to this northern trans-Jordanian town because it was a place of refuge. It is in the general vicinity of Jabesh-Gilead, the town inhabited by Saul’s allies and perhaps kinsmen. Mephibosheth, it will be recalled, was five years old when he was dropped by his nurse and crippled in the flight after the defeat at Gilboa. Since it seems implausible that more than fifteen or so years would have passed since that moment, one may surmise that he is now a man in his twenties.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1879" class="s27" name="bookmark1892">6. </a><a href="#bookmark1879" class="a">Mephibosheth . . . flung himself on his face and prostrated </a>himself<span class="p">. These gestures of abasement may have been standard etiquette in approaching a monarch, but Ziba is not reported making them. Mephibosheth is clearly terrified that the king may have summoned him in order to have him put to death—David’s possible complicity in the deaths of other figures associated with the house of Saul might well have been a matter of continuing speculation in Benjaminite circles. As Fokkelman aptly notes, it would have been a particularly painful business for a man crippled in both legs to fling himself down in this fashion.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1880" class="s27" name="bookmark1893">7. </a>I will give back to you all the land of Saul<span class="p">.

The Hebrew <i>na‘ar </i>denotes subservience, but it is unclear whether, as some have claimed, it indicates Ziba’s role as majordomo (the philological grounds for</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">that construction are shaky) or rather his subaltern status in the house of Saul.</p></li><li data-list-text="10."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1882" class="a" name="bookmark1895">your </a><span class="s20">slaves</span>. The Hebrew term ‘<i>eved </i>straddles the sense of freeborn underling and slave. Ziba evidently belongs to the former category, and so the designation <i>‘eved </i>is rendered as “servant” when it is attached to him. It seems likely that the underlings of a prosperous servant would be slaves. Polzin has noted that different forms of this verbal stem occur ten times in the chapter, which is all about establishing lines of dominance and subservience.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1883" class="a" name="bookmark1896">and you shall bring food for your master’s house and they will </a>eat<span class="p">. The translation here follows the text of the Septuagint. The Masoretic text reads: “and you shall bring and it will be food for your master’s son and he will eat it.” That version can be maintained only with strain, for the very next clause informs us that Mephibosheth was not dependent on the yield of his own land but resided in Jerusalem, sustained at the royal table.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="11."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1884" class="a" name="bookmark1897">And Mephibosheth ate at David’s </a>table<span class="p">. Again, the translation follows the Septuagint.

The refrainlike repetition of this clause should give us pause. David is indeed treating Jonathan’s crippled son like one of his own sons, “keeping faith” or “showing kindness” to the offspring of his dead comrade, as he had pledged. He surely means his benefaction to be publicly perceived. At the same time, it is clearly in David’s interest to keep the only conceivable Saulide pretender to the throne close at hand, under easy scrutiny. Mephibosheth’s condition is ostensibly that of an unofficially adopted son, but with an uneasy suspicion that it is really a kind of luxurious house arrest.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1886" class="a" name="bookmark1899">And he was lame in both his </a><span class="s20">feet</span>. This emphatic concluding reiteration of his physical impairment might be intended, as some commentators have proposed, to explain why he could not travel back and forth between his estate and Jerusalem. But it surely also strikes a plaintive note at the end, underscoring the vulnerability of Mephibosheth, whether cosseted or held under surveillance in the Jerusalem court. As the court becomes more and more the arena of plots and murderous conflict, Mephibosheth will be victimized by someone close to him. This notice at the end about Mephibosheth’s lameness also underscores the continuing antithesis between the fates of the house of Saul and the house of David: King David came into Jerusalem whirling and dancing before the L<span class="s22">ORD</span>; the surviving Saulide limps into Jerusalem, crippled in both legs</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">CHAPTER 10</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1914" class="s28" name="bookmark1900">A</a><a href="#bookmark1914" class="s5">nd it happened </a>thereafter <a href="#bookmark1915" class="s6">that the king of the Ammonites died and Hanun his son was king in his stead.

Once again this vague temporal formula reflects the achronological ordering of the text. Since the Aramean king Hadadezer is reported in 8:3–7 to have been decisively defeated by David and to have become David’s vassal, the campaign that is represented here, in which Hadadezer musters Aramean forces east of the Euphrates in order to confront David, must have taken place as part of David’s victorious struggle with Aram Zobah registered in the summary of Chapter 8. This whole account of military operations—given its rather dry technical style, it may well have been drawn from Davidic annals—is meant to establish the facts of continuing armed conflict with the Ammonites, which is the crucial background for the story of David and Bathsheba in the next chapter.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1901" class="a" name="bookmark1915">Let me keep faith with Hanun son of Nahash as his father kept faith with </a>me<span class="p">. This chapter, like the preceding one, opens with a declaration of David’s desire to keep faith with, or do kindness to, the son of a father toward whom he feels some prior obligation. There is no notice in the previous narrative of Nahash’s having done favors for David, but several scholars have surmised that Nahash’s enmity toward Saul (see 1 Samuel:11) might have led him to provide refuge or logistical support to David and his men when they were being hunted down by Saul.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1902" class="a" name="bookmark1916">to search out the </a>city<span class="p">. As Moshe Garsiel notes, the walled cities of the ancient Near East often had tunnels, underground conduits, or other points of vulnerability that could provide access to the enemy in a siege.

The Ammonites thus are not merely insulting the ambassadors personally but provocatively violating their diplomatic privilege.

Shimon Bar-Efrat observes that this narrative sequence is formally structured by the “seeing” of David’s trans-Jordanian adversaries (here, verse 14, verse 15, verse 19), in counterpoint to David’s “hearing.” The latter implies receiving word at a distance, as does the associated locution, “it was told to David,” whereas the former signifies immediate observation. Thus Joab, making out the deployment of hostile forces on the battlefield, is also said to see.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="7."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1906" class="a" name="bookmark1920">David heard and sent out </a>Joab<span class="p">.

The Israelite forces are in danger of being caught in the pincer movement between the Aramean mercenaries advancing on them from the northeast and the Ammonites, presumably to the south. Joab rapidly improvises a counterstrategy, selecting a corp of elite troops to assault the larger force of Arameans and sending his brother Abishai with the rest of the troops against the Ammonites. Such attention to military detail is quite untypical of biblical narrative, as is the rousing battlefield exhortation (verse 12) with which Joab concludes his instructions. The point of such detail is surely to show Joab as a superbly competent and resolute field commander, just before the great pivotal episode in the next chapter in which Joab maintains the siege against Rabbath Ammon while his commander in chief slumbers, and lusts, in Jerusalem.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="10."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1909" class="a" name="bookmark1923">the rest of the troops he </a>gave<span class="p">.

And Joab sent and told David </a><a href="#bookmark1982" class="s11">all the details of the battle. And Joab charged the messenger, saying, “When you finish reporting all the details of the battle to the king, if it should happen that the king’s wrath is roused and he says to you, ‘Why did you approach the town to fight?

There is a cunning ambiguity here in the Hebrew text. The  received  consonantal  text  reads  <i>mal’akhim</i>,  “messengers,”  though  many manuscripts show <i>melakhim</i>, “kings.” As Polzin observes, the verb “to sally forth” (or, in nonmilitary contexts, “to go forth”) is often attached to kings and never to messengers, so “kings” is definitely the more likely reading, though the ghost of “messengers” shows through in the letters of the text. Polzin beautifully describes this double take: “the verse clearly doubles back on itself in a marvelous display of narrative virtuosity: at a time when kings go forth, David did not, making it a time, therefore, when messengers must go forth; at a time when messengers go forth, David, remaining</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">in Jerusalem, sent Joab, his servants and all Israel to ravage Ammon.” What some see here as a scribal error may well be a deliberate orthographic pun</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1930" class="a" name="bookmark1962">David sent out </a>Joab<span class="p">. The verb “to send”—the right verb for “messengers”—occurs eleven times in this chapter, framing the beginning and the end. This episode is not a moral parable but a story anchored in the realities of political history. It is concerned with the institutionalization of the monarchy. David, now a sedentary king removed from the field of action and endowed with a dangerous amount of leisure, is seen constantly  operating  through  the  agency  of  others,  sending  messengers  within Jerusalem and out to Ammonite territory. Working through intermediaries, as the story will abundantly show, creates a whole new order of complications and unanticipated consequences.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1931" class="a" name="bookmark1963">And David was sitting in </a>Jerusalem<span class="p">. The verb for “sitting” also means “to stay” (compare verse 12), but it is best to preserve the literal sense here because of the pointed sequence: sitting, lying, rising, and because in biblical usage “to sit” is also an antonym of “to go out” (or sally forth).</span></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1932" class="a" name="bookmark1964">at </a><span class="s20">eventide</span>. The Hebrew term <i>‘et‘erev </i>echoes ironically with the phrase <i>‘et tse’t</i>, “at the time of sallying forth” in the previous verse. A siesta on a hot spring day would begin not long after noon, so this recumbent king has been in bed an inordinately long time.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1933" class="a" name="bookmark1965">he saw from the </a><span class="s20">roof</span>. The palace is situated on a height, so David can look down on the naked Bathsheba bathing, presumably on her own rooftop. This situation of the palace also explains why David tells Uriah to “go down” to his house. Later in the story, archers deal destruction from the heights of the city wall, the Hebrew using the same preposition, <i>me’al</i>, to convey the sense of “from above.”</p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1966">&zwnj;</a>the one he sent said<span class="p">. The Hebrew uses an unspecified “he said.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1935" class="a" name="bookmark1967">Bathsheba daughter of Eliam wife of Uriah the </a><span class="s20">Hittite</span>. It is unusual to identify a woman by both father and husband. The reason may be, as Bar-Efrat suggests, that both men are members of David’s elite corps of warriors. Although Uriah’s designation as Hittite has led some interpreters to think of him as a foreign mercenary, the fact that he has a pious Israelite name (“the L<span class="s22">ORD </span>is my light”) suggests that he is rather a native or at least a naturalized Israelite of Hittite extraction. In any case, there is obvious irony in the fact that the man of foreign origins is the perfect Good Soldier of Israel, whereas the Israelite king betrays and murders him.</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1936" class="a" name="bookmark1968">David sent . . . and fetched her and she came to him and he lay with </a>her<span class="p">. It is not uncommon for biblical narrative to use a chain of verbs in this fashion to indicate rapid, single-minded action. What is unusual is that one verb in the middle of this sequence switches grammatical subject—from David to Bathsheba. When the verb “come to” or “come into” has a masculine subject and “into” is followed by a feminine object, it designates a first act of sexual intercourse. One wonders whether the writer is boldly toying with this double meaning, intimating an element of active participation by</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Bathsheba in David’s sexual summons. The text is otherwise entirely silent on her feelings, giving the impression that she is passive as others act on her. But her later behavior in the matter of her son’s succession to the throne (1 Kings 1–2) suggests a woman who has her eye on the main chance, and it is possible that opportunism, not merely passive submission, explains her behavior here as well. In all of this, David’s sending messengers first to ask about Bathsheba and then to call her to his bed means that the adultery can scarcely be a secret within the court.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1969">&zwnj;</a>cleansed herself of her impurity<span class="p">. The reference is to the ritually required bath after the end of menstruation. This explains Bathsheba’s bathing on the roof and also makes it clear that she could not be pregnant by her husband.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="5."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1938" class="a" name="bookmark1970">I am </a>pregnant<span class="p">. Astonishingly, these are the only words Bathsheba speaks in this story. In keeping with the stringent efficiency of biblical narrative, the story leaps forward from the sexual act to the discovery of pregnancy.</span></p></li></ol><ol id="l126"><li data-list-text="8."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1939" class="a" name="bookmark1971">Go down to your house and bathe your </a>feet<span class="p">. Some interpreters have made this more heavy-handed than it is by construing the final phrase as a euphemism for sex (because “feet” in the Bible is occasionally a euphemism for the male genitals). But in the biblical world, bathing the feet is something travelers regularly do when they come from the dusty road. This bathing of the feet stands in a kind of synecdochic relation to Bathsheba’s bathing of her whole body, discreetly suggesting that after the bathing of the feet, other refreshments of the body will ensue.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1940" class="a" name="bookmark1972">the king’s </a>provisions<span class="p">.

The verb “to lie,” according to David’s expectations, should have been followed by “with his wife.” Instead, we have not sex but a soldier’s sleeping with his comrades, who are guarding the king. It should be remembered (compare 1 Samuel 21) that soldiers in combat generally practiced sexual abstinence.</span></p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1942" class="s27" name="bookmark1974">11. </a><a href="#bookmark1942" class="a">sitting in </a><span class="s20">huts</span>. Some construe <i>sukot</i>, “huts,” as a place-name, the city of Succoth a little east of the Jordan. But if the Ark is sent out of Jerusalem to the front, it would make no sense to detain it at a logistics center only halfway to the battlefield, and Uriah’s point is that neither the Ark nor the troops enjoy proper shelter (while David is “sitting in Jerusalem”).</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1943" class="a" name="bookmark1975">shall I then come to my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my </a>wife? <span class="p">Uriah now spells out all that David left unsaid when he urged him to go down to his house. The crucial detail of sleeping with Bathsheba comes at the very end. Menakhem Perry and Meir Sternberg, in a pioneering Hebrew article in 1968 (revised by Sternberg for his English book of 1985), raised the provocative issue of deliberate ambiguity (comparing the strategy of this story with the two mutually exclusive readings possible for Henry James’s short story “The Turn of the Screw”). In their view, there are two equally viable</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">readings. If Uriah does <i>not </i>know that David has cuckolded him, he is the instrument of dramatic irony—the perfect soldier vis-à-vis the treacherous king who is desperately trying to manipulate him so that the husband will unwittingly cover the traces of his wife’s sexual betrayal. If Uriah <i>does </i>know of the adultery, he is a rather different character—not naive but shrewdly aware, playing a dangerous game of hints in which he deliberately pricks the conscience of the king, cognizant, and perhaps not caring, that his own life may soon be forfeit. More recently, Moshe Garsiel has proposed a reconciliation of these two readings: when Uriah first arrives from the front, he is unaware of what has occurred; after the first night with his comrades at the palace gate, he has been duly informed of the sexual betrayal, so that in his second dialogue with the king, he cultivates a rhetoric of implicit accusation. Garsiel observes that when Uriah swears emphatically by David’s life (verse 11), he does not add the deferential “my lord the king.”</p><ol id="l127"><li data-list-text="13."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1976">&zwnj;</a>David called him<span class="p">.

The letter would be in the form of a small scroll with either a seal or threads around it. David is counting on the fact that Uriah as a loyal soldier will not dream of opening the letter. If he does not know of the adultery, he has in any case no personal motive to look at the letter. If he does know, he is accepting his fate with grim resignation, bitterly conscious that his wife has betrayed him and that the king is too powerful for him to contend with.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="15."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1948" class="a" name="bookmark1980">so that he will be struck down and </a>die<span class="p">. With no possibility of making Uriah seem responsible for Bathsheba’s pregnancy, David now gravely compounds the original crime of adultery by plotting to get Uriah out of the way entirely by having him killed. What follows in the story makes it clear that bloodshed, far more than adultery, is David’s indelible transgression.</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1949" class="s27" name="bookmark1981">17. </a><a href="#bookmark1949" class="a">some of the troops . . . fell, and Uriah the Hittite also </a>died<span class="p">. As Perry and Sternberg have keenly observed, one of the salient features of this story is the repeated alteration of instructions by those who carry them out. It is, indeed, a vivid demonstration of the ambiguous effecting of ends through the agency of others, which is one of the great political themes of the story. The canny Joab immediately sees that David’s orders are impossibly clumsy (perhaps an indication that the Machiavellian David has suddenly lost his manipulative coolness): if the men around Uriah were to draw back all at once, leaving him alone exposed, it would be entirely transparent that there was a plot to get him killed. Joab, then, coldly recognizes that in order to give David’s plan some credibility, it will be necessary to send a whole contingent into a dangerous place and</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">for many others beside Uriah to die. In this fashion, the circle of lethal consequences of David’s initial act spreads wider and wider.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1950" class="s27" name="bookmark1982">21. </a><a href="#bookmark1950" class="a">Did not a woman fling down on him an upper millstone . . . </a>? <span class="p">The specificity of the prospective dialogue that Joab invents for a wrathful David may at first seem surprising. The story of the ignominious death of Abimelech at the hand of a woman (Judges 9:52– 54) may have become a kind of object lesson in siege strategy for professional soldiers</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">—when you are laying siege against a city, above all beware of coming too close to the wall. One suspects also that Joab’s emphasis on a woman’s dealing death to the warrior</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">—Abimelech had asked his armor bearer to run him through so that it would <i>not </i>be said he was killed by a woman!—points back to Bathsheba as the ultimate source of this chain of disasters.

Joab obviously knows that this is the message for which David is waiting. By placing it in the anticipatory “script” that he dictates to the messenger, he is of course giving away the secret, more or less, to the messenger. Might this, too, be calculated, as an oblique dissemination of David’s complicity in Uriah’s death, perhaps to be used at some future point by Joab against the king? In any case, given David’s track record in killing messengers who bear tidings not to his liking, Joab may want to be sure that this messenger has the means to fend off any violent reaction from the king, who would not have been expecting a report of multiple casualties.</span></p><ol id="l128"><li data-list-text="23."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1952" class="a" name="bookmark1984">and then we were upon them back to the entrance of the </a>gate<span class="p">. The astute messenger offers a circumstantial account that justifies the mistake of approaching too close to the wall: the Ammonites came out after the Israelites in hot pursuit; then the Israelites, turning the tide of battle, were drawn after the fleeing Ammonites and so were tricked into coming right up to the gates of the city.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="24."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1953" class="a" name="bookmark1985">and your servant Uriah the Hittite also </a>died<span class="p">. The messenger has divined the real point of Joab’s instructions all too well. He realizes that what David above all wants to hear is the news of Uriah’s death, and rather than risk the whole outburst, indicated by the prospective dialogue invented by Joab with the reference to the woman who killed Abimelech, the messenger hastens to conclude his report, before the king can react, by mentioning Uriah’s death. Thus the narrative makes palpable the inexorable public knowledge of David’s crime.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="25."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1954" class="a" name="bookmark1986">the sword devours sometimes one way and sometimes </a>another<span class="p">. The king responds by directing to Joab what sounds like an old soldier’s cliché (on the order of “every bullet has its billet”). These vapid words of consolation to the field commander are an implicit admission that Joab’s revision of David’s orders was necessary: David concedes that many a good man had to die in order to cover up his murder by proxy of Uriah.</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1955" class="a" name="bookmark1987">Battle all the more </a>fiercely<span class="p">.

The second stage of the story of David and Bathsheba—the phase of accusation and retribution—begins with a virtual pun on a prominent thematic word of the first half of the story. David was seen repeatedly “sending” messengers, arranging for the satisfaction of his lust and the murder of his mistress’s husband through the agency of others. By contrast, God here “sends” his prophet to David—not an act of bureaucratic manipulation but the use of a human vehicle to convey a divine message of conscience.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1993" class="a" name="bookmark2023">Two men there </a><span class="s20">were</span>. Nathan’s parable, from its very first syllables, makes clear its own status as a traditional tale and a poetic construction. The way one begins a storyteller’s tale in the Bible is with the formula “there was a man”—compare the beginning of Job, or the beginning of the story of Hannah and Elkanah in 1 Samuel 1. The Hebrew prose of the parable also is set off strongly from the language of the surrounding narrative by its emphatically rhythmic character, with a fondness for parallel pairs of terms—an effect this translation tries to reproduce. The vocabulary, moreover, includes several terms that are relatively rare in biblical prose narrative: <i>kivsah </i>(ewe), <i>ra’sh </i>(poor), <i>helekh </i>(wayfarer), ’<i>orea</i><span class="s26">ḥ </span>(wayfarer). Finally the two “men” of the opening formula are at the end separated out into “rich man,” “poor man,” and “the man who had come” (in each of these cases, Hebrew <i>’ish </i>is used). This formal repetition prepares the way, almost musically, for Nathan’s two-word accusatory explosion, <i>’atah ha’ish</i>, “You are the man!” Given the patently literary character of Nathan’s tale, which would have been transparent to anyone native to ancient Hebrew culture, it is a little puzzling that David should so precipitously take the tale as a report of fact requiring judicial action. Nathan may be counting on the possibility that the obverse side of guilty conscience in a man like David is the anxious desire to do the right thing. As king, his first obligation is to protect his subjects and to dispense justice, especially to the disadvantaged. In the affair of Bathsheba and Uriah, he has done precisely the opposite. Now, as he listens to Nathan’s tale, David’s compensatory zeal to be a champion of justice overrides any awareness he might have of the evident artifice of the story.</p><ol id="l129"><li data-list-text="3."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 16pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1994" class="a" name="bookmark2024">eat . . . drink . . . </a>lie<span class="p">. As Polzin observes, these terms effect full contact with the story of David and Bathsheba, being the three activities David sought to engage Uriah in with his wife (compare Uriah’s words in 11:11). The parable begins to become a little fantastic here in the interest of drawing close to the relationships of conjugal intimacy and adultery to which it refers: the little lamb eats from her master’s crust, drinks from his cup, and lies in his lap (“lap” as a biblical idiom has connotations not merely of</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">parental sheltering but also of sexual intimacy: compare verse 8, “I gave . . . your master’s wives in your lap”).</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1995" class="a" name="bookmark2025">it seemed a pity to </a>him<span class="p">.

Actually, according to biblical law someone who has illegally taken another’s property would be subject to fourfold restitution (verse 6), not to the death penalty. (The Hebrew phrase is literally “son of death”—that is, deserving death, just as in 1 Samuel 26:16.) David pronounces this death sentence in his outburst of moral indignation, but it also reflects the way that the parable conflates the sexual “taking” of Bathsheba with the murder of Uriah: the addition of Bathsheba to the royal harem could have been intimated simply by the rich man’s placing the ewe in his flock, but as the parable is told, the ewe must be slaughtered, blood must be shed. David himself will not be condemned to die, but death will hang over his house. As the Talmud (Yoma 22B) notes, the fourfold retribution for Uriah’s death will be worked out in the death or violent fate of four of David’s children: the unnamed infant son of Bathsheba, Tamar, Amnon, and Absalom.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark1999" class="s27" name="bookmark2029">7. </a><a href="#bookmark1999" class="a">Thus says the L</a><a href="#bookmark1999" class="s21">ORD </a><a href="#bookmark1999" class="a">God of </a>Israel<span class="p">.

The obliquity of working through agents at a distance, as David did in contriving the murder of Uriah, is exploded by the brutal directness of the language: it is as though David himself had wielded the sword.

As Bar-Efrat notes, David’s rather callous message to Joab, “the sword sometimes consumes one way and sometimes another,” is now thrown back in his face. The story of David’s sons, not to speak of his descendants in later generations, will in fact turn out to be a long tale of conspiracy, internecine struggle, and murder. One of the most extraordinary features of the whole David narrative is that this story of the founding of the great dynasty of Judah is, paradoxically, already a tale of the fall of the house of David. Once again, no one has grasped this tragic paradox more profoundly than William Faulkner in his recasting of the story in <i>Absalom, Absalom! </i>The author of the David story continually exercises an unblinking vision of David and the institution of the monarchy that exposes their terrible flaws even as he accepts their divinely authorized legitimacy.</p></li><li data-list-text="11."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2004" class="a" name="bookmark2034">I am about to raise up evil against you from your own </a>house<span class="p">. As befits a predictive curse, the agents of the evil are left unnamed. The disaster announced is clearly the rebellion of Absalom—as the reference to public cohabitation with David’s wives makes clear—and the rape of Tamar and the murder of Amnon that lead up to it. But further “evil” from the house of David will persist to his deathbed, as Absalom’s rebellion is followed by Adonijah’s usurpation.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="12."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2005" class="a" name="bookmark2035">For you did it in secret but I will do this thing before all </a>Israel<span class="p">.

In Hebrew, this is a single syllable, <i>met</i>, “dead”—a response corresponding to idiomatic usage because there is no word for “yes” in biblical Hebrew, and so the person questioned must respond by affirming the key term of the question. It should be noted, however, that the writer has contrived to repeat “dead” five times,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">together with one use of the verb “died,” in these two verses: the ineluctable bleak fact of death is hammered home to us, just before David’s grim acceptance of it.</p></li><li data-list-text="20."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2012" class="a" name="bookmark2042">David rose . . . bathed . . . rubbed himself with oil . . . changed his garments . . . worshiped . . . ate</a><a href="#bookmark2012" class="s27">. This uninterrupted chain of verbs signifies David’s brisk </a>resumption of the activities of normal life, evidently without speech and certainly without explanation, as the courtiers’ puzzlement makes clear. The entire episode powerfully manifests that human capacity for surprise, and for paradoxical behavior, that is one of the hallmarks of the great biblical characters. David here acts in a way that neither his courtiers nor the audience of the story could have anticipated.</p></li></ol><ol id="l133"><li data-list-text="23."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2013" class="a" name="bookmark2043">Can I bring him back again?

If the episode of Bathsheba and Uriah is the great turning point of the David story, these haunting words are the pivotal moment in the turning point. As we have repeatedly seen, every instance of David’s speech in the preceding narrative has been crafted to serve political ends, much of it evincing elaborately artful rhetoric. Now, after the dire curse pronounced by Nathan, the first stage of which is fulfilled in the death of the child, David speaks for the first time not out of political need but in his existential nakedness. The words he utters have a stark simplicity—there are no elegies now—and his recognition of the irreversibility of his son’s death also makes him think of his own mortality. In place of David the seeker and wielder of power, we now see a vulnerable David, and this is how he will chiefly appear through the last half of his story.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="24."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2014" class="a" name="bookmark2044">David consoled Bathsheba his </a>wife<span class="p">. Now, after the terrible price of the child’s life has been paid for the murder of her husband, the narrator refers to her as David’s wife, not Uriah’s.

As a rule, it was the mother who exercised the privilege of naming the child. Despite some scholarly efforts to construe the name differently, its most plausible etymology remains the one that links it with the word for “peace” (the Hebrew term <i>Shelomoh </i>might simply mean “His peace”). The L<span class="s22">ORD</span>’<span class="s22">S </span>loving Solomon, who will disappear from the narrative until the struggle for the throne in 1 Kings 1, foreshadows his eventual destiny, and also harmonizes this name giving with the child’s second name, Jedidiah, which means “God’s friend.”</p></li><li data-list-text="25."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2016" class="a" name="bookmark2046">Jedidiah, by the grace of the L</a><span class="s32">ORD</span>. For the last phrase, this translation adopts a proposal by Kyle McCarter, Jr. The usual meaning of the preposition used, <i>ba‘avur, </i>is “for the sake of.” It remains something of a puzzlement that the child should be given two names, one by his mother and the other by God through His prophet. One common suggestion is that Jedidiah was Solomon’s official throne name. But perhaps the second name, indicating special access to divine favor, reflects a political calculation on the part of Nathan: he is already aligning himself with Solomon (and with Bathsheba), figuring that in the long run it will be best to have a successor to David under some</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">obligation to him.

Joab is actually sending David a double message. As dutiful field commander, he urges David (verse 28) to hasten to the front so that the conquest of the Ammonite capital will be attributed to him. And yet, he proclaims the conquest in the triumphal formality of a little victory poem (one line, two parallel versets) in which it is he who figures unambiguously as conqueror. This coy and dangerous game Joab plays with David about who has the real power will persist in the story.</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2019" class="a" name="bookmark2049">the Citadel of </a>Waters<span class="p">.

The catastrophic turn in David’s fortune began when he saw a beautiful woman and lusted after her.

The Hebrew <i>rea‘ </i>could simply indicate a friend, though in royal contexts it is also the title of someone who played an official role as the king’s, or the prince’s, companion and counselor. The emphasis on Jonadab’s “wisdom”—in biblical usage, often a morally neutral term suggesting mastery of know-how in a particular activity— makes the technical sense of counselor more likely, though one role does not exclude the other.</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2056" class="a" name="bookmark2098">And he said to </a>him<span class="p">. Shimon Bar-Efrat has aptly observed that the whole story of the rape of Tamar is constructed out of seven interlocking scenes with two characters in each, one of whom appears in the next scene. (The story of the stealing of Isaac’s blessing in Genesis 27 has the same structure.) The sequence is: (1) Jonadab-Amnon,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(2) Amnon-David, (3) David-Tamar, (4) Tamar-Amnon, (5) Amnon-attendant, (6) attendant-Tamar, (7) Tamar-Absalom. J. P. Fokkelman adds to this observation that the spatial and structural center of this design is the bed in Amnon’s inner chamber (4), where the rape is perpetrated.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2057" class="a" name="bookmark2099">Tamar the sister of Absalom my </a><span style=" color: #00F;">brother</span><span class="p">.

David at the beginning of the Bathsheba story was first seen lying in bed, and then he arranged to have the desired woman brought to his chamber. Jonadab on his part observes that Amnon already looks ill (verse 2) and so suggests that he play up this condition by pretending to be dangerously ill and in need of special ministrations.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2059" class="a" name="bookmark2101">nourish  </a><span class="s20">me</span>.  The  Hebrew  verbal  root  <i>b-r-h  </i>and  the  cognate  noun  <i>biryah </i>(“nourishment”) denote not eating in general but the kind of eating that is sustaining or restoring to a person who is weak or fasting. When you eat a <i>biryah </i>you become <i>bar’i</i>, healthy or fat, the opposite of “poorly,” <i>dal</i>. The distinction is crucial to this story.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2060" class="a" name="bookmark2102">so that I may see and eat from her </a>hand<span class="p">. Perhaps Amnon is encouraged to say this because, as a person supposed to be gravely ill, he would want to see with his own eyes that the vital nourishment is prepared exactly as it should be. The writer is clearly playing with the equivalence between eating and sex, but it remains ambiguous whether Jonadab has in mind the facilitating of a rape, or merely creating the possibility of an intimate meeting between Amnon and Tamar.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="6."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2061" class="a" name="bookmark2103">the king came to see </a>him<span class="p">. In Jonadab’s original scenario, it was to be Absalom who played this role.

The verb and its object are both transparently cognate with <i>lev </i>(or <i>levav</i>), “heart.” The term could refer to the shape of the dumplings, or to their function of “strengthening the heart” (idiomatic in biblical Hebrew for sustaining or encouraging). In the Song of Songs, this same verb is associated with the idea of sexual arousal.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2063" class="s27" name="bookmark2105">9. </a><a href="#bookmark2063" class="a">Clear out everyone around </a>me! <span class="p">The identical words are pronounced by another princelike figure, Joseph, just before he reveals his true identity to his brothers (Genesis 45:1). In Genesis, these words preface the great moment of reconciliation between long- estranged brothers. Here they are a prelude to a tale of fraternal rape that leads to fratricide. The story of the rape of Tamar continues to allude to the Joseph story, in reverse chronological order and with pointed thematic reversal. The moment before the rape echoes the encounter between Joseph and Potiphar’s wife (Genesis 39) in the middle of the Joseph story, and the attention drawn to the ornamented tunic that the violated Tamar tears takes us back to Joseph’s ornamented tunic at the beginning of his story (Genesis 37). From such purposeful deployment of allusion, the inference is inevitable that the author of the David story was familiar at least with the J strand of the Joseph story in a textual version very like the one that has come down to us.</span></p><ol id="l136"><li data-list-text="11."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2064" class="a" name="bookmark2106">Come lie with me, my </a>sister<span class="p">. The core of this abrupt command is a citation of the words of Potiphar’s wife to Joseph, “Lie with me.” Perhaps, as some have suggested,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Come” has a slight softening effect. The addition of “my sister” of course highlights the fact that this sexual assault is also incestuous.</p></li><li data-list-text="12."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2065" class="a" name="bookmark2107">Don’t, my </a>brother<span class="p">. Tamar’s response constitutes a structural allusion to Joseph and Potiphar’s wife, for he, when confronted by the sexual brusqueness of her terse “lie with me,” also responds, in contrastive dialogue, with a nervous volubility in a relatively lengthy series of breathless objections.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2108">&zwnj;</a>it should not be done thus in Israel . . . this scurrilous thing. <span class="p">The language here echoes that of another sexual episode in Genesis, the rape of Dinah (Genesis 34). Again, the divergence in the parallel is significant, for Dinah’s rapist comes to love her after violating her and wants to make things good by marriage, whereas Amnon despises Tamar after he possesses her, and drives her away. The rape in both stories leads to murderous fraternal vengeance. But our writer’s brilliant game of literary allusion does not end here, for, as Robert Polzin has pointed out, Tamar’s words are also a precise echo of the plea of the Ephraimite in Gibeah to the mob of rapists: “Don’t, my brothers</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">. . . don’t do this scurrilous thing” (Judges 19:23). That story ended in the woman’s being gang-raped to death, an act that in turn led to bloody civil war—as Tamar’s rape will lead to fratricide and, eventually, rebellion and civil war.</p></li><li data-list-text="13."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2067" class="a" name="bookmark2109">speak, pray, to the king, for he will not withhold me from </a>you<span class="p">. Marriage between a half brother and a half sister is explicitly banned by biblical law. Perhaps, it has been suggested, this prohibition was not yet held to be binding in the early tenth century, or in the royal circle in Jerusalem. But it is at least as plausible that the desperate Tamar is grasping at any possibility to buy time. and deflect her sexual assailant: why do this vile thing and take me by force when you can enjoy me legitimately?</span></p></li><li data-list-text="14."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2068" class="a" name="bookmark2110">he overpowered her and abused her and bedded </a><span class="s20">her</span>. The three transitive verbs in quick sequence reflect the single-minded assertion of male physical force. In the analogous story of Joseph and the Egyptian woman, because the gender roles are reversed, the sexually assaulted male is strong enough to break free from the woman’s grasp and flee. Here, the assaulted woman cannot break her assailant’s grip (verse 11), and so she now succumbs to brute force. The verb represented as “bedded” (<i>shakhav</i>) is the same one used by Jonadab in verse 5 (“Lie in your bed,” <i>shekhav ‘al-mishkavkha</i>) and in Amnon’s “lie with me.” But when it has a direct feminine object (instead of “lie <i>with</i>”), it suggests sexual violation, and a transitive verb is called for in the English.</p></li><li data-list-text="15."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2069" class="a" name="bookmark2111">greater was the hatred with which he hated her than the love with which he had loved her</a><a href="#bookmark2069" class="s27">. The psychological insight of this writer is remarkable throughout the </a>story. Amnon has fulfilled his desire for this beautiful young woman—or, given the fact that she is a bitterly resistant virgin, perhaps it has hardly been the fulfillment he dreamed of. In any case, he now has to face the possibly dire consequences to himself from her brother Absalom, or from David. The result is an access of revulsion against Tamar, a blaming of the victim for luring him with her charms into all this trouble.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2070" class="a" name="bookmark2112">Get up, </a>go! <span class="p">The brutality of these imperative verbs is evident.

There is a textual problem here in the Hebrew, which seems to say, “Don’t—about this wrong . . .” (</span>‘al-’odot hara‘ah<span class="p">). Some versions of the Septuagint read here, “Don’t, my brother” (</span>‘al ’a<span class="s26">ḥ</span>i<span class="p">), as in verse 12, but this could reflect an attempt to straighten out a difficult text rather than a better Hebrew version used by the ancient Greek translators.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2072" class="a" name="bookmark2114">to send me away </a>now<span class="p">. “Now” is added in the translation in order to remove an ambiguity as to when the sending away is done. “Sending away” is an idiom that also has the sense of “divorce”—precisely what the rapist of a virgin is not allowed to do in biblical law. If some modern readers may wonder why being banished seems to Tamar worse than being raped, one must say that for biblical women the social consequence of pariah status, when the law offered the remedy of marriage to the rapist, might well seem even more horrible than the physical violation. Rape was a dire fate, but one that could be compensated for by marriage, whereas the violated virgin rejected and abandoned by her violator was an unmarriageable outcast, condemned to a lifetime of “desolation” (verse 20).</span></p></li><li data-list-text="17."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2073" class="a" name="bookmark2115">Send this creature, pray, away from </a><span class="s20">me</span>. “This creature” reflects the stingingly contemptuous monosyllabic feminine demonstrative pronoun, <i>zo’t </i>(“this one”).

The translation for this term follows a suggestion of E. A. Speiser. (The famous King James Version rendering in Genesis is “coat of many colors.”) Others interpret this as a garment reaching the ankles. In any case, Tamar and Joseph are the only two figures in the Bible said to wear this particular garment. Joseph’s, too, will be torn, by his brothers, after they strip him of it and toss him into the pit, and they will then soak it in kid’s blood. Tamar’s ornamented tunic may well be blood-stained, too, if one considers what has just been done to her as a virgin.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="19."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2076" class="a" name="bookmark2118">put her hand on her </a>head<span class="p">.

This identification, which plays back against the heavily fraught, often ironic uses of “brother” and “sister” throughout the story, would hardly be a consolation. What Absalom may be suggesting is that, were it any other man, I would avenge your honor at once, but since he is your brother, and mine, I must bide my time (“<i>For now</i>, my sister, hold your peace.”)</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2079" class="a" name="bookmark2121">Do not take this matter to </a>heart<span class="p">.

That imponderable silence is the key to the mounting avalanche of disaster in the house of David. Where we might expect some after-the-fact defense of his violated daughter, some rebuke or punishment of his rapist son, he hears, is angry, but says nothing and does nothing, leaving the field open for Absalom’s murder of his brother. In all this, the rape of Tamar plays exactly the same pivotal role in the story of David as does the rape of Dinah in the story of Jacob. Jacob, too, “hears” of the violation and does nothing, setting the stage for the bloody act of vengeance carried out by his sons Simeon and Levi. By the end of the episode, Jacob is seen at the mercy of his intransigent sons, and that is how this once-powerful figure will appear through the rest of his story. An analogous fate, as we shall abundantly see, awaits David from this moment on.</span></p></li></ol><ol id="l137"><li data-list-text="23."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2081" class="a" name="bookmark2123">a sheep </a>shearing<span class="p">.

Tekoa is a village about ten miles north of Jerusalem. Why does Joab contrive to make David agree to Absalom’s return? Given his relentlessly political character, it seems likely that Joab perceives Absalom’s continuing banishment as a potential source of rebellion against the throne, and concludes that the safest course is to reconcile the king with his son. This calculation will prove to be gravely misguided because Joab does not reckon with David’s ambivalence toward his fratricidal son (see verse 24) or with the impulse to usurpation that the ambivalence will encourage in Absalom.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2170">&zwnj;</a>a wise woman<span class="p">. It should be noted that the whole David story, seemingly dominated by powerful martial men, pivots at several crucial junctures on the intervention of enterprising “wise women.” The first of these is Abigail, though, unlike two of the others, she is not assigned the epithet “wise woman” as a kind of professional title. Later, a resourceful woman hides the two spies who are bringing intelligence of Absalom to David in trans-Jordan. In the subsequent rebellion of Sheba son of Bichri, another wise woman prevents Joab’s massacre of the besieged town of Abel of Beth- Maacah.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2139" class="a" name="bookmark2171">like a woman a long while mourning over a dead </a>one<span class="p">.

As Polzin observes, the entire episode turns on manipulation of people through language, with abundant repetition of the verb “speak.” In contrast to the common practice elsewhere in biblical narrative, we are not given the actual script that Joab dictates to the woman, which she will then repeat to David. This omission heightens the sense that, using a general outline provided by Joab, the woman is in fact brilliantly improvising—which in some ways she would have to do, given the fact that she is not reciting an uninterrupted speech but responding to David’s declarations, picking up clues from the way he reacts.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2173">&zwnj;</a>Rescue, O king! <span class="p">This is a formulaic plea used by petitioners for royal justice.</span></p></li></ol><ol id="l141"><li data-list-text="6."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2142" class="a" name="bookmark2174">they quarreled in the field . . . and one struck down the </a>other<span class="p">.

Although it is unlikely that the clansmen would have actually said these words, there is no need to tamper with the text. The wise woman, in reporting the dialogue, insinuates her own anxious maternal perspective into this last clause. The implication is that the members of the clan would like to kill the remaining son not only to execute justice but in order to get his inheritance.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="8."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2144" class="a" name="bookmark2176">I myself shall issue a charge concerning </a><span class="s20">you</span>. Although David emphatically announces (by adding the first-person pronoun ’<i>ani</i>) that he himself will take up the case, his language remains vague (“issue a charge”), and the Tekoite woman’s response in the next verse clearly indicates that she requires something further of him.</p></li><li data-list-text="9."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2145" class="a" name="bookmark2177">Upon me . . . the guilt . . . and the king and his throne shall be </a>blameless. <span class="p">The legal issue involved is blood guilt.

Her declaration that she and her father’s house will bear the guilt for allowing the killer to live—evidently construed by David as a performative speech act, efficacious once uttered—encourages the king to declare that he will absolutely protect her against the vengeful kinsmen who are seeking out her son.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="11."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2147" class="a" name="bookmark2179">let them not destroy my </a>son. <span class="p">The woman is still not satisfied, for David’s pledge to safeguard her did not mention her son: she wants to extract an explicit declaration from David that he will protect the life of her son.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2148" class="a" name="bookmark2180">not a single hair of your son’s shall fall to the </a>ground<span class="p">. Now she has what she has been after, with David’s hyperbolic declaration about guarding the well-being of the fratricidal son, she is prepared to snap shut the trap of the fiction, linking it to David’s life, just as Nathan did with the parable of the poor man’s ewe. We should note that not a single hair of the fictitious son is to fall to the ground, whereas the extravagantly abundant hair of his real-life referent, Absalom, will be cut annually in a kind of public ceremony.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="12."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2149" class="a" name="bookmark2181">Let your servant, pray, </a>speak<span class="p">.

Moving beyond Absalom to a wise woman’s pronouncement on human fate, she breaks free of her verbal stumbling and becomes eloquent. The spilled water as an image of irreversible mortality is an obvious and effective counterpoint to her previous image of the ember that should not be quenched. It also picks up thematically David’s own bleak reflection on the irreversibility of death after his infant son expires (Chapter 12).</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2185">&zwnj;</a>God will not bear off the life of him who devises that no one of his be banished<span class="p">.

There is clearly something narcissistic about this preoccupation with his luxuriant hair. It is of course a foreshadowing of the bizarre circumstances of Absalom’s death (Chapter 18:9–15). Beyond that, the spectacular growth of hair invokes a comparison with Samson, who never cut his hair until the cutting of the hair against his will led to his undoing. The parallel with Samson is extended in the burning of Joab’s field, which recalls the foxes with torches tied to their tails used by Samson to set fire to the fields of the Philistines. Perhaps the parallel with Samson is meant to foreshadow Absalom’s fate as a powerful leader whose imprudence brings him to an early death.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="27."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2162" class="a" name="bookmark2194">And three sons were born to Absalom and a daughter named Tamar, she was a beautiful woman</a><a href="#bookmark2162" class="s27">.

It is unnecessary to assume that this second beautiful Tamar was born after the violation of her aunt by Amnon: here she is represented as a woman, and it seems unlikely that so many years would have passed from the time of Tamar’s rape until Absalom’s resumption of residence in Jerusalem.</p></li></ol><ol id="l144"><li data-list-text="29."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2163" class="a" name="bookmark2195">he did not want to </a>come<span class="p">.

All this vehicular pomp and circumstance, as other biblical references to chariots, horses, and runners in conjunction with kings suggest, is a claim to royal status.

It is hard to imagine realistically that Absalom would tell each person so flatly that, whatever the legal case, he would declare in his favor, but the point of the stylization is clear: the demagogue enlists support by flattering people’s special interests, leading them to believe that he will champion their cause, cut their taxes, increase their social security benefits, and so forth.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2202" class="a" name="bookmark2228">you have no one to listen to you from the </a>king. <span class="p">The heart of Absalom’s demagogic pitch is his exploiting what must have been widespread dissatisfaction over the new centralized monarchic bureaucracy with its imposition of taxes and corvées and military conscription: there is no one in this impersonal palace to listen to you with a sympathetic ear, as I do.</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2203" class="s27" name="bookmark2229">5. </a><a href="#bookmark2203" class="a">he would reach out his hand and take hold of him and kiss </a>him. <span class="p">The odd “rhyming” of Absalom’s kiss to each man he seduces and David’s kiss to Absalom at the end of the immediately preceding chapter is obvious. Could it suggest, retrospectively, that David’s kiss has an element of falseness that recurs, grossly magnified, in Absalom’s kiss? It should also be noted that Absalom’s gesture of “taking hold” of each of his political victims is verbally identical with Amnon’s “taking hold” of Tamar before the rape.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2204" class="s27" name="bookmark2230">7. </a>at the end of four years<span class="p">.

Haim Gevaryahu proposes that the vow is to offer an exculpatory sacrifice for the crime of manslaughter. With three years in Geshur and another four in Jerusalem, Absalom would have come to the end of the period of seven years of penance that, according to some ancient parallels, might have</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">applied to such crimes. Absalom of course wants to go off to Hebron—David’s first capital city—in order to proclaim himself king at a certain distance from his father’s palace. It also appears that he feels he can call on a base of support from Judah, his father’s tribe. But why is not David suspicious when his son proposes to pay his cultic vow in Hebron rather than in Jerusalem? Gevaryahu, citing Greek analogues, makes the interesting suggestion that a fratricide who had not yet atoned for his crime was not permitted to worship in the same sanctuary as his father and brothers.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2206" class="s27" name="bookmark2232">11. </a><a href="#bookmark2206" class="a">invited guests going in all </a>innocence<span class="p">. In a shrewd maneuver, Absalom takes with him a large contingent of people not known to be his partisans, and not willing participants in the conspiracy, and in this way he wards off suspicion about the aim of his expedition. Once in Hebron, the two hundred men would presumably be caught up in the tide of insurrection.</span></p><ol id="l147"><li data-list-text="14."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2207" class="a" name="bookmark2233">Rise and let us </a>flee<span class="p">. Suddenly, under the pressure of crisis, with intelligence that Absalom has overwhelming support, David shakes himself from his slumber of passivity, realizing he must move at once if he is to have any chance of surviving. Against superior forces, the walled city of Jerusalem would be a death trap. As Fokkelman aptly puts it, “Once again he is in contact with his old self. . . . Once again men seek his death and he enters the wilderness both figuratively and literally.”</span></p></li><li data-list-text="15."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2208" class="a" name="bookmark2234">Whatever my lord the king chooses, look, we are your </a>servants<span class="p">.

This restatement of the first clause of the previous verse reflects the device that biblical scholars call “resumptive repetition”: after an interruption of the narrative line—here, the introduction of the information about the concubines—the words just before the interruption are repeated as the main line of the narrative resumes.

The entire episode is unusual in the leisurely panoramic view it provides of the eastward march from the city. Instead of the preterite verb form ordinarily used for narration, participial forms (“were crossing over”) predominate, imparting a sense of something like a present tense to the report of the action.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2213" class="a" name="bookmark2239">Cherethites . . .

David, informed that his own shrewd political advisor Ahitophel is part of Absalom’s conspiracy, urgently and breathlessly invokes God, “Thwart, pray, the counsel of Ahitophel, O L<span class="s22">ORD</span>.” Then he reaches a holy site, an altar on the crest of the Mount of Olives (“where one would bow down to God”), and here he sees Hushai, his loyalty betokened by the trappings of mourning he has assumed, coming toward him. Theologically, Hushai is the immediate answer to David’s prayer. Politically, David seizes upon Hushai as the perfect instrument to thwart Ahitophel’s counsel, so from a certain point of view David is really answering his own prayer through his human initiative.

The verbal motif of “crossing over,” which virtually defines David’s flight eastward from Jerusalem to trans-Jordan, is continued here. It will be given another odd turn in verse 17 when the bloody-minded Abishai volunteers to “cross over” and lop off Shimei’s head.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2275">&zwnj;</a>a little beyond the summit<span class="p">. The summit in question is of course the top of the Mount of Olives, where David has just encountered Hushai and sent him off to Jerusalem as an undercover agent.

The Hebrew term for summit used here is <i>ro’sh</i>, which is the ordinary word for “head,” and as Polzin goes on to note, “head” is an organizing image of the entire episode: David goes up the mountainside with his head uncovered in a sign of mourning, as do the people with him. Hushai puts dirt on his head as a related expression of mourning. Both Hushai and Ziba are encountered on or near the head of the mountain. Abishai is prepared to cut off Shimei’s head. And, as in other languages, head also designates political leader—an ironic verbal background to his moment when the head of all Israel has been displaced. Finally, Absalom’s usurpation will come to a violent end when his head—the narrator does not say hair—is caught in the branches of a tree.</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2254" class="a" name="bookmark2276">for the king’s </a>household<span class="p">.

It is noteworthy that, at this late date, David still refers to Mephibosheth as “your master’s son,” still thinks of the long-dead Jonathan as Ziba’s real master.</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2257" class="a" name="bookmark2279">Today the house of Israel will give back to me my father’s </a>kingdom<span class="p">. There is no corroborating evidence in the story that Mephibosheth actually said these words. What in fact seems to be happening is that Ziba is flatly lying about his master in order to make himself appear to be the only loyal subject worthy of David’s benefactions, and of title to Saul’s property. The notion Ziba puts forth that Absalom would have turned over the throne to the surviving Saulide is highly improbable, but what he proposes to David is that the purportedly treacherous Mephibosheth sees in the general political upheaval of the rebellion an opportunity to reinstate the house of Saul.</span></p><ol id="l151"><li data-list-text="5."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2258" class="a" name="bookmark2280">as far as </a>Bahurim<span class="p">.

The proud, canny, often implacable David here resigns himself to accepting the most stinging humiliation from a person he could easily have his men kill. David’s abasement is not a disguise, like Odysseus’s when he takes on the appearance of a beggar, but a real change in condition—from which, however, he will emerge in more than one surprising way. The acceptance of humiliation is a kind of fatalism: if someone commits such a sacrilegious act against the man who is God’s anointed king, it must be because God has decreed it. Behind that fatalism may be a sense of guilt: I am suffering all this because of what I have done, for taking Bathsheba and murdering her husband, for my inaction in Amnon’s rape of Tamar and Absalom’s murder of Amnon. The guilt is coupled with despair: as David goes on to say, When my own son is trying to kill me, what difference could it make if this man of a rival tribe, who at least has political grounds for hostility toward me, should revile me?</span></p></li></ol><ol id="l152"><li data-list-text="13."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2264" class="a" name="bookmark2286">cursing and hurling stones at him and flinging </a>dirt<span class="p">.

The plural forms, then, suggest that Absalom has been persuaded by Hushai and has accepted him into his circle of court counselors.

His act, of course, is a fulfillment of Nathan’s dire curse in Chapter 12.

Hushai, as Fokkleman has observed, pairs the traditional simile of the sands of the seashore with a more innovative, yet related simile of dew on the field. The dew falls silently, effortlessly, and this is how this huge army will “light upon” David’s forces.

Ahitophel proposed a strategy through which it might be possible to kill David alone and then to enlist the support of his followers. Hushai’s counsel is to annihilate David’s forces, a much more violent means of preventing civil war. The bloodthirsty alternative evidently appeals to something in Absalom, who is unwilling to trust the future loyalty of the troops who have remained with David.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="13."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2313" class="a" name="bookmark2344">should he withdraw into a </a>town<span class="p">.

This is still another instance in the David story in which the enterprising intervention of a shrewd woman saves the day. As has often been noted, this moment alludes to the story told in Joshua 2 of Rahab the harlot, who hides the two spies sent out to Jericho by Joshua. In Joshua, the spies are hidden up above, in the roof thatch; here they hide below in the well. There may be a certain agricultural affinity between the covering of thatch and the cloth covered with groats (if that is what the anomalous Hebrew <i>rifot </i>means) under which the pairs of spies hide. In any case, the destruction of all the men of Jericho who sought Joshua’s spies foreshadows the destruction of Absalom’s army.</p></li><li data-list-text="20."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2320" class="a" name="bookmark2351">They’ve crossed over past the water </a><span class="s20">reservoir</span>.

Ahitophel kills himself not only because, in quasi-Japanese fashion, he has lost face, but also out of sober calculation: he realizes that Hushai’s counsel will enable David to defeat Absalom, and with the old king returned to the throne, an archtraitor like Ahitophel will surely face death.

There are two different problems with the identification of Amasa’s progenitors in the Masoretic text. The Masoretic version has “Israelite,” but this national label (rather than identification by tribe) would be strange here, and the same Ithra in 1 Chronicles 2:17 is said, more plausibly, to be the son of an Ishmaelite. The fact that the father is a member of another national-ethnic group accords with the report that he “had come to bed with Abigail,” for that sexual term by no means necessarily implies marriage. The Masoretic text makes Nahash, an Ammonite, Abigail’s father, but it looks as though that name may have drifted into this verse in scribal transcription from verse 27. 1 Chronicles 2 more plausibly reports that Jesse was Abigail’s father. She would then be the sister of David and of Zeruiah, Joab’s mother; and so Amasa and Joab, the two army commanders, are first cousins, and both of them David’s nephews.</span></p></li></ol><ol id="l158"><li data-list-text="28."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2325" class="a" name="bookmark2356">beans and </a>lentils<span class="p">.

Most obviously, the head of hair that was his narcissistic glory is now the instrument of his fatal entrapment, Absalom the commander microcosmically enacting the fate of his army “devoured” by the forest. There is nothing supernatural here—David’s forces have shrewdly taken advantage of the irregular terrain—yet there is a sense that nature is conspiring against Absalom and his men. The mule is in this period the usual mount for princes and kings (one should recall that all the king’s sons ride away on their mules after Absalom has Amnon killed), so Absalom’s losing his mule from under him is an image of his losing his royal seat. Having climbed from exile and rejection to the throne, he now dangles helplessly between sky and earth. The mule’s “passing on” (‘<i>avar</i>), as Polzin notes, picks up the key verb (“cross over”) that has characterized David’s flight from the royal city. Fokkelman brilliantly shows that there is also a whole series of contrastive parallels between Absalom’s fate and that of his counselor Ahitophel: “The counselor rides calmly on his ass to his home while the prince is abandoned by his mule, a fatal loss. He is thrown into an unknown, nameless and ignominious grave while Ahitophel is ‘buried in his father’s grave’. . . . With all these contrasts, they have one detail in common: both finally hang.”</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2365" class="a" name="bookmark2396">he </a>dangled<span class="p">. The Masoretic text has “he was given,” but ancient translations into Aramaic, Syriac, Greek, and Latin, now confirmed by the Qumran Samuel scroll, read “dangled,” a difference of a single consonant in the Hebrew.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2366" class="s27" name="bookmark2397">11. </a><a href="#bookmark2366" class="a">And look, you </a>saw<span class="p">. The contemptuous Joab throws the soldier’s own words back into his face: if that’s what you really saw, why didn’t you have the brains to finish him off on the spot and get the reward I would have given you? Joab, in his unflinching resolution to kill Absalom in defiance of David’s explicit orders to the contrary, remains the consummately calculating political man—something David once was but no longer is. When Joab thought it was politically prudent to reconcile David with Absalom, he took elaborate steps to achieve that end. Now he realizes that an Absalom allowed to survive is likely to be a source of future political dissension and that the only sure way to eliminate this threat is Absalom’s death.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2367" class="s27" name="bookmark2398">12. </a><a href="#bookmark2367" class="a">were I to heft in my palms a thousand pieces of </a>silver<span class="p">. The soldier responds to Joab’s contempt with righteous indignation, multiplying the hypothetical reward a hundredfold and turning the general act of giving silver into a concrete hefting of its weight in order to express how sacred he holds the king’s injunction, which, we now see, has in fact been heard by “all the troops” (verse 5).</span></p><ol id="l160"><li data-list-text="14."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2368" class="a" name="bookmark2399">he took three sticks in his </a><span class="s20">palm</span>. Over against the soldier’s palms hyperbolically hefting a thousand pieces of silver, Joab’s palm grasps a blunt instrument of violence. The Hebrew <i>shevatim </i>means “sticks,” not “darts,” as it is often translated, and had they been darts, the blow would surely have been fatal. On the contrary, it seems probable that Joab’s intention is not to kill the prince—after all, this military man is an experienced killer—but rather to stun him and hurt him badly, and then to spread the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">responsibility for the death by ordering the warriors to finish him off. Fokkelman proposes that the three sticks jibe with the three divisions of the army, so that Joab performs a deliberately symbolic act, “executing the rebellious prince on behalf of the whole army.”</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2369" class="a" name="bookmark2400">into Absalom’s heart, still alive in the heart of the </a>terebinth<span class="p">.

The Hebrew <i>ne‘arim, </i>“lads,” in its sense of elite fighting men, rings dissonantly against David’s repeated paternal designation of Absalom as <i>na‘ar</i>, “lad.”</p></li><li data-list-text="16."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2402">&zwnj;</a><span class="s20">sounded</span>. The Hebrew reflects an untranslatable pun because the verb <i>taqa‘</i>, “to make a piercing sound with a horn,” also means to thrust or stab, and is the word just used to report Joab’s blow to the heart.</p></li><li data-list-text="17."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2372" class="a" name="bookmark2403">the big </a>hollow<span class="p">. An alternative rendering is “pit,” but “hollow” is used here to preserve the verbal identity in the Hebrew between this moment and Hushai’s imaginary description in Chapter 17 of David’s hiding in “one of the hollows.” To be flung into a hole in the field and covered with a heap of stones is a shameful burial.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="18."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2404">&zwnj;</a><span class="s20">Absalom had . . . heaped up a cairn</span>. This brief notice, in the pluperfect tense, draws a pointed contrast with Absalom’s ignominious grave. The same verb, “to heap up,” is used for both, and the cairn, or commemorative pile of stones (<i>not </i>a “pillar”) is the grandiose image that is transformed into the pile of stones over Absalom’s body.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2374" class="a" name="bookmark2405">I have no son to make my name </a><span class="s20">remembered</span>. Faulkner’s <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i>, with reference to both its David figure and its Absalom figure, beautifully catches the pathos of these words. Those who have sought to harmonize this verse with 14:27, where Absalom is said to have fathered three sons, propose that the sons died, their early death explaining why they are left unnamed.</p><ol id="l161"><li data-list-text="21."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2375" class="a" name="bookmark2406">the </a>Cushite<span class="p">. This Nubian is the third foreign messenger introduced into the story (the other two are the Egyptian slave who informs David of the whereabouts of the Amalekite raiding party and the Amalekite who reports Saul’s death to David). Joab appears to exhibit a certain paternal concern for Ahimaaz, a priest and a faithful agent of David’s during the insurrection—in the next verse he addresses him as “my son.” Joab is keenly aware that David has in the past shown himself capable of killing the bearer of ill tidings in a fit of rage, and so the commander prefers to let a foreigner take the risk.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="22."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2376" class="a" name="bookmark2407">yours are not welcome </a>tidings<span class="p">. The Hebrew—literally, “finding tidings”—is anomalous, and has inspired both emendation and excessively ingenious interpretation. The immediate context suggests “welcome” as the most plausible meaning, and this could easily be an idiom for which there are no other occurrences in the biblical corpus, which, after all, provides only a small sampling of ancient Hebrew usage. In fact, these</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">two words, <i>besorah motsei’t</i>, could well be an idiomatic ellipsis for <i>besorah motsei’t</i></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ḥ<span class="s19">en</span><span class="p">, “tidings finding favor (in his eyes).”</span></p></li><li data-list-text="23."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2408">&zwnj;</a>by the way of the Plain<span class="p">. The Plain in question is the Jordan Valley on the east side of the river. Some have suggested that Ahimaaz overtakes the Cushite not by speed but by running along a flatter, if less direct, route in the Jordan Valley riverbed, but verses 25– 27 indicate that Ahimaaz outruns the Cushite.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="24."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2378" class="a" name="bookmark2409">David was sitting between the </a>gates<span class="p">. Walled cities in ancient Israel and environs often had double walls, with an inner and outer gate and a small plaza between them. Moshe Garsiel neatly observes that David’s ambivalence about the armed struggle is spatially figured by his physical location: he wanted to sally forth with the army; the troops wanted him within the town; he stations himself in between. Before the battle he stood by the gate; now he is seated by the gate, awaiting the news from the front—as Polzin notes, exactly like Eli, who is told of the death of his two sons.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2379" class="a" name="bookmark2410">the lookout went up on the roof of the gate . . . and he raised his eyes and </a>saw<span class="p">. This moment is quite exceptional, and striking, in representing the arrival of the two messengers visually, from the perspective of the lookout on the wall reporting to David down below in the gate plaza. David’s troubles with all his sons, it should be remembered, began when he himself looked down from a roof and saw a woman bathing.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="25."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2380" class="a" name="bookmark2411">If he’s alone, there are tidings in his </a>mouth<span class="p">.

This obvious non sequitur suggests that the desperately anxious David is grasping at straws. In fact, as revelatory dialogue, it shows us just how desperate he feels.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="28."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2382" class="a" name="bookmark2413">All is </a><span class="s20">well</span>. This is one word in the Hebrew, <i>shalom</i>. That word is the last two syllables of Absalom’s name in Hebrew, ’<i>Avshalom</i>, a link David will reinforce when he nervously asks, “Is it well [<i>shalom</i>] with the lad Absalom [’<i>Avshalom</i>]?”</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2383" class="a" name="bookmark2414">Who has delivered over the men who raised their hands against my lord the </a>king<span class="p">.

This seems to be David’s overriding concern, not the military victory. Again and again, he insists on the term of affection, “lad,” for the rebel son who would have killed him. The tension between his political role, which, as Joab understood, requires Absalom’s destruction, and his paternal role, is painfully palpable. In this connection, it is noteworthy that David, so much the emotionally vulnerable father here, is consistently referred to as “the king,” not as “David.”</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2416">&zwnj;</a>I saw a great crowd to send the king’s servant<span class="p">. This is nearly gibberish but not because of any corruption of the text. Ahimaaz has been posed a question he does not dare answer, and so he begins to talk nervously and incoherently (“and I know not what</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">. . .”).</p></li><li data-list-text="30."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2386" class="a" name="bookmark2417">Turn aside, stand </a>by! <span class="p">David, realizing he is unlikely to extract anything from the babbling Ahimaaz, decides to wait and interrogate the second messenger, whose arrival is imminent.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="31."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2387" class="a" name="bookmark2418">Let my lord the king receive the </a>tidings<span class="p">. The Cushite is considerably more brusque than his predecessor. He does not begin with a reassuring “All is well.” There is no indication of his bowing down before the king. He proceeds quickly to the report of the victory, and though the language of that report approximately parallels Ahimaaz’s language, it is briefer, and ends with “against you” instead of the more deferential “against my lord the king.”</span></p></li><li data-list-text="32."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2388" class="a" name="bookmark2419">May the enemies of my lord the king be like the </a>lad<span class="p">. The Cushite promptly and clearly responds by reporting Absalom’s death, though even he has enough sense to phrase it indirectly, neither mentioning Absalom by name nor using the word “died.” In referring to the usurper as “the lad,” he is quoting David, but without having picked up the crucial cue of David’s paternal feelings reflected in the word. He blithely assumes that because Absalom was at the head of “all who have risen against” the king, the news of his death will be welcome. It strikes exactly the right note that the Cushite’s very last word is “evil” (or, “harm”).</span></p></li></ol><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">CHAPTER 19</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2420">&zwnj;</a><span class="s3">A</span><a href="#bookmark2461" class="s6">nd the king was shaken.

When his infant son by Bathsheba died, he spoke somber words about his own mortality and the irreversibility of death. Now, the eloquent David is reduced to a sheer stammer of grief, repeating over and over the two Hebrew words, <i>beni ’Avshalom</i>, “my son, Absalom.” Although the narrator continues to refer to David only as “the king,” in the shifting conflict between his public and private roles the latter here takes over entirely: Absalom is not the usurper who drove him from the throne but only “my son,” and David is the anguished father who would rather have died, that his son might have lived.</p><ol id="l164"><li data-list-text="3."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2421" class="a" name="bookmark2462">for the troops had heard on that </a>day<span class="p">.

This striking image of victory transformed into the bitterness of defeat picks up verbal threads, as Moshe Garsiel has perceptively noted, from the beginning of Absalom’s insurrection (Chapter 15). There, the usurper stood at the gate, as David is here made to go out and sit in the gate. Absalom was said to “steal the heart” of the men of Israel as here the men steal away, and in order to recover dominion David is enjoined to speak to their heart (verse 8). The disheartened slipping away of the troops suggests that Joab is addressing an imminent danger of the disintegration of the army.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="5."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2423" class="a" name="bookmark2464">the king covered his </a><span class="s20">face</span>.

The implication is that Joab speaks with David in private.

Again and again here Joab insists on the word “today.” It is this very moment, he suggests, this crucial turning point, that you must seize in order to reestablish your reign. You cannot allow yourself to think of the past, of your history as Absalom’s father: as king, you must confront <i>today</i>, with its challenge and its political responsibilities.</p></li><li data-list-text="7."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2426" class="a" name="bookmark2467">to love those who hate you and to hate those who love </a>you<span class="p">.

In all this, Joab’s verbal assault on David, however motivated by pressing considerations of practical politics, is also a defense of his own flouting of David’s injunction to protect Absalom. David at this point knows only the bare fact of his son’s death, not who was responsible for it. This is something that he will inevitably soon learn, and that bitter knowledge is surely registered in his decision to replace Joab with Amasa (verse 14).</span></p></li><li data-list-text="9."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2430" class="a" name="bookmark2471">the king arose and sat in the </a>gate<span class="p">. Fokkelman brilliantly observes the disparity between Joab’s exhortation and the report of David’s action. Joab had said, “go out, and speak to the heart of your servants.” Instead of these active gestures, we see David passively sitting in the gate while the troops come to him, and we are given no reported speech for him. In Fokkelman’s reading, this gap between command and act “call[s] up the image of a man beaten to a pulp, who can barely stand, and does only the minimum requested or expected of him.”</span></p></li><li data-list-text="10."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2472">&zwnj;</a><span class="s20">deliberating. </span>The verb <i>nadon </i>in this verse is conventionally related to the noun <i>madon, </i>“quarrel” or “contention.” But in fact what the people say is not contentious, and it is preferable to derive the passive (perhaps implicitly reflexive) verbal form here from <i>dun</i>, to judge, consider, or deliberate.</p></li></ol><ol id="l165"><li data-list-text="12."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2432" class="a" name="bookmark2473">Why should you be the last to bring back the </a>king<span class="p">. Throughout this episode, there is a central focus on who will be first and who will be last to show support for the Davidic restoration. The northern tribes, Israel, have already evinced support (verse 10), and David is concerned to enlist the backing of his own tribe, Judah, which had largely swung to Absalom during the insurrection.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2474">&zwnj;</a>regarding his house<span class="p">.

The extraordinary offer of the post of commander of the army to Absalom’s general in the rebellion reflects David’s knack for combining personal and political motives. It is a slap in the face to Joab, the killer of David’s son, against whom David evidently does not dare to take any more direct steps</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of vengeance. At the same time, the hesitation of the Judahites in rallying behind the restored king suggests that an act such as the appointment of Amasa as commander may be required to enlist their support. Joab, not surprisingly, will not quietly acquiesce in his abrupt dismissal from the office he has held since the beginning of David’s career.</p></li><li data-list-text="15."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2436" class="a" name="bookmark2477">he inclined the </a>heart<span class="p">. It is not clear whether the Hebrew, characteristically overgenerous in its use of pronouns, intends the “he” to refer to David or to Amasa. In either case, David’s overture succeeds in bringing the tribe of Judah into his camp.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="16."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2437" class="a" name="bookmark2478">to bring the king across the </a><span class="s20">Jordan</span>. The verb <i>‘avar, </i>“cross over,” and its causative form, <i>ha‘avir, </i>“to bring across,” which thematically defined David’s exodus from Jerusalem in Chapter 15, dominates this episode, too, as the crossing over in flight to the east is reversed by the crossing over westward back to Jerusalem.</p></li><li data-list-text="17."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2479">&zwnj;</a>Shimei son of Gera<span class="p">. There is an approximate symmetry between David’s encounters in his exodus from Jerusalem and those that now occur in his return. Then he met a hostile Shimei, now he meets a contrite Shimei. Then he met Ziba, who denounced his master Mephibosheth; now he meets Mephibosheth himself, who defends his own loyalty. Then he spoke with Ittai, the loyalist who insisted on accompanying him; now he speaks with Barzillai, the proven loyalist who refuses to accompany him back to the capital. The encounter with Hushai, who becomes David’s secret agent, has no counterpart here.</span></p></li></ol><ol id="l166"><li data-list-text="21."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2480">&zwnj;</a>first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king<span class="p">. Shimei, who has rushed down to the Jordan in order to demonstrate his newfound loyalty to David, uses “the house of Joseph” loosely to refer to the northern tribes.

He “goes down” because his hometown of Bahurim is in the high country near Jerusalem.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="22."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2440" class="a" name="bookmark2481">For this should not Shimei be put to </a>death? <span class="p">Abishai remains true to character, for the third time prepared to kill someone on the impulse of the moment.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="23."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2441" class="a" name="bookmark2482">What do I have to do with you, sons of </a>Zeruiah<span class="p">.

This “Solomonic” judgment may actually be another sign that David has lost his ruler’s grip. For if Ziba has told the truth about his master, Mephibosheth as a traitor would deserve nothing, except perhaps capital punishment. And if Ziba was lying, then the servant would deserve nothing except a harsh legal penalty for defamation. Perhaps Mephibosheth is paying a price for having betrayed that he thought David was responsible for the Saulide deaths: in this reading, David knows Mephibosheth is telling the truth, but he punishes him for assuming David was involved in the killings by decreeing Mephibosheth will lose half his property.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="31."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2450" class="a" name="bookmark2490">Let him even take </a>all<span class="p">.

Though ten to one might merely be idiomatic for great preponderance, it seems likely that they allude to the fact that they are ten tribes to Judah’s one—if David is king of the entire nation, this gives them ten times the claim to the king that Judah has. The phrase “even in David” (or, “also in David”) is a little odd, and the Septuagint reads instead, “also I am firstborn more than you.” It should be noted that all the pronouns in this dialogue in the Hebrew are cast in the first person singular, referring to a singular, collective “man of Israel” and “man of Judah,” but that usage doesn’t quite work in English.</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2460" class="a" name="bookmark2501">the word of the men of Judah was harsher than the word of the men of </a>Israel<span class="p">. The episode concludes in a clash of words, to be followed by a clash of swords. The implication of the greater “harshness” (or, “hardness”) of the Judahite words is aptly caught by the medieval Hebrew commentator David Kimchi: “Their word was harsher and stronger than the word of the men of Israel, and the men of Judah spoke harshly to</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the men of Israel, with the king saying nothing to them.

The narrative is a direct continuation of the end of the previous chapter, and so “there” is the national assembly grounds at Gilgal where the northern tribes, Israel, and the tribe of Judah have just quarreled. The northerners, resentful of the harshness of the Judahites’ words, in which the members of David’s own tribe claimed a special proprietary relationship with the king, are ripe for the appeal of a demagogue such as Sheba, who is at once identified as “a worthless fellow.” </a><a href="#bookmark2503" class="a">We have no share in </a>David<span class="p">.

The concubines have become taboo to David because they cohabited with Absalom his son. But this whole sad notice suggests that David now cannot fully “come back to his house.” The women he left, perhaps foolishly and surely futilely, “to watch over the house” are now sequestered “in a house under watch.” There is a wry echo in all this of that early moment of David’s investment of Jerusalem when he was confronted by another wife he had left behind who had slept with another man—Michal. She had no child “till her dying day”—an image of interrupted conjugality that is multiplied tenfold here with the concubines.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2506" class="a" name="bookmark2540">the king said to </a>Amasa<span class="p">.

Although it is not clear why Amasa is late for his appointed meeting with David (perhaps his appearance at Gibeon in verse 8 suggests that he decided, out of military considerations, to pursue Sheba at once without reporting back to the king), David’s unjustified panic is another indication that he has lost his political composure. By sending out Abishai, Joab’s brother, to give chase after Sheba, he sets up the circumstances for Joab’s murder of Amasa and his subsequent return to power.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2543">&zwnj;</a>You, take your master’s servants<span class="p">.

In any case, the idea strongly suggested by the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">context is that Sheba would place himself beyond the reach of pursuit by withdrawing into fortified towns. In the event, he is trapped inside just such a town.</p></li><li data-list-text="7."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2511" class="a" name="bookmark2545">Joab’s men sallied </a>forth<span class="p">. J. P. Fokkelman must be credited with seeing what an extraordinary designation this is. David has dismissed Joab. The elite warriors are in any case David’s men (note how David has just referred to them in addressing Abishai as “your master’s servants”). The fact that they are here called “Joab’s men” suggests where the real power is, and where Joab’s brother Abishai assumes it must be. The clear implication is that the supposedly dismissed Joab is actually leading his men in the pursuit.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="8."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2512" class="a" name="bookmark2546">They were just by the great stone which is in </a>Gibeon<span class="p">. Gibeon, it should be recalled, is the very place where the civil war between the house of Saul (Israel) and the house of David (Judah) began. That first battle (2 Samuel 2) began with a choreographed duel between twelve champions from each side, each warrior clasping the head of his adversary and stabbing him in the side. Joab’s posture in the killing of Amasa strikingly recalls those lethal gestures.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2513" class="a" name="bookmark2547">he had on a belt for a sword strapped to his waist . . . and as he came forward, it slipped out</a><a href="#bookmark2513" class="s27">. The sword—often, as here, a weapon closer to a long </a>dagger—was customarily strapped against the left thigh, for easy unsheathing across the lower belly by a right-handed fighter. Joab may have deliberately fastened the sword to his waist so that it would slip out of the scabbard as he leaned forward to embrace Amasa. The last two verbs here are rather cryptic in the Hebrew: literally “he/it went out and she/it fell/slipped.” Since “sword” is feminine in Hebrew, that is the only likely subject for “slipped,” and “he” (Joab) is the plausible masculine subject for “went out” (or, “came forward”), though it could also be the scabbard. Josephus’s reading of this verse remains the most persuasive one: the wily Joab, deliberately allowing his dagger to slip to the ground as he bends forward, then snatches it up with his left hand while his right hand grasps Amasa’s beard.</p></li><li data-list-text="9."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2514" class="a" name="bookmark2548">so as to kiss </a>him<span class="p">.

His attention caught by Joab’s gesture of affection, Amasa does not think to look at Joab’s left hand, which one would not normally expect to hold a weapon. (Has Joab learned the lesson of Ehud, Judges 3, who takes the Moabite king Eglon by surprise with a dagger thrust to the belly delivered by the left hand?) Joab’s manual proficiency as a killer reinforces the perception that he struck at Absalom in the heart with sticks, not “darts,” in order to hurt him badly but deliberately not to finish him off. The phrase “did not watch out” rhymes ironically with the plight of the ten concubines left to watch over the house and condemned to a house under watch.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2516" class="a" name="bookmark2550">he struck him with it in the belly and spilled his innards to the </a><span class="s20">ground</span>.

This is the first of several verbal clues intended to establish a link between this episode involving a “wise woman” and the episode of the wise woman of Tekoa that prepared the way for Absalom’s return to Jerusalem, which then eventuated in the rebellion. Both women seek to deflect an impulse of vengeful violence. The Tekoite implores the king to take steps “that the blood avenger not savage this much” (2 Samuel 14:11). She fears those bent on “destroying me and my son together from God’s heritage” (14:16), just as the wise woman of Abel Beth-Maacah asks Joab, “Why should you engulf the L<span class="s22">ORD</span>’<span class="s22">S </span>heritage?” He responds by saying “Far be it from me . . . that I should engulf and that I should destroy [the same root as the verb rendered as “savage”].</p></li><li data-list-text="16."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2523" class="a" name="bookmark2557">Listen, listen—speak, pray, to </a>Joab<span class="p">.

The burden of what she</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">says here is that Abel has long been a revered city, so why would Joab think of destroying it?</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2525" class="a" name="bookmark2559">and thus </a>conclude<span class="p">.

The literal Hebrew is “town and mother,” a hendyadis that clearly means something like “principal town.” (The phrase would remain idiomatic in later Hebrew.) Since in biblical Hebrew the suburbs or outlying villages around a town are called “daughters,” the logic of the idiom is evident. It is, however, an idiom that appears only here in the entire biblical corpus, and there is thematic point in its use. In this narrative reflecting a male warrior culture and acts of terrible violence, from decapitation to evisceration, a series of female figures—Abigail, the Tekoite, the wise woman of Abel—intervene to avert violence. The city itself is figured as a mother; its destruction would be a kind of matricide, and the wise woman speaks on behalf of the childbearers and nurturers of life in Israelite society to turn aside Joab’s terrible swift sword.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="20."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2528" class="a" name="bookmark2562">But a man from the high country of </a>Ephraim<span class="p">.

This list of David’s royal bureaucracy parallels the one in 8:16–18, with a couple of instructive differences. The two serve as bookends to David’s reign in Jerusalem. The first is introduced after he has consolidated his mini- empire, and this one after the suppression of two successive rebellions and just before the account of David’s last days in 1 Kings 1–2. (As we shall see, the remaining four chapters of 2 Samuel are actually a series of appendices to the story proper and not a direct continuation of it.) In Chapter 8, Joab was simply “over the army.” Here, after the defeat of the secessionist northern tribes, he is said to be “over all the army of Israel.” Adoram as supervisor of the corvée does not appear in the earlier list but is inserted here to anticipate the role he will play in Solomon’s grand building projects, and he may in fact have been a much later appointment by David. The name of the royal scribe, Sheva, is anomalous in the Hebrew, and may be the same person identified in Chapter 8 as Seraiah.</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2535" class="s27" name="bookmark2569">26. </a>And Ira the Jairite was also a priest to David<span class="p">.

These chapters appear to be a series of appendices to the David story proper, manifestly written by different writers in styles that exhibit notable differences from that of the main narrative, and also certain differences in ideological assumptions and even in what are presumed to be the narrative data of David’s history. It should, however, be kept in mind that creating a collage of disparate sources was an established literary technique used by the ancient Hebrew editors and sometimes by the original writers themselves. Recent critics have abundantly demonstrated the compositional coherence of Chapters 21–24 and have argued for some significant links with the preceding narrative. For that reason, it may be preferable to think of this whole unit as a coda to the story rather than as a series of appendices. The structure of the chapters is neatly chiastic, as follows: a story of a national calamity in which David intercedes; a list (Chapter 21); a poem (Chapter 22); a poem; a list (Chapter 23); a story of a national calamity in which David intercedes (Chapter 24). The temporal setting of these</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">materials is unclear but they seem to belong somewhere in the middle of David’s career, and do not follow from the late point in his reign reported in the immediately preceding account of the rebellion of Sheba son of Bichri. The editors placed these chapters here, rather than after David’s death, and then set the account of his last days, which they interrupt, at the beginning of 1 Kings in order to underline the dynastic continuity between David’s story and Solomon’s, which then immediately follows as the first large unit of the Book of Kings.</p><ol id="l174"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2571" class="a" name="bookmark2597">David sought out the presence of the L</a><span class="s32">ORD</span>.

Polzin neatly observes that this phrase precisely echoes “they fell together” of 2:16—the account of the beginning of the civil war at this very same place, Gibeon. He also notes how this whole episode is organized around recurring units of three and seven, the latter number <i>shiv‘ah </i>punning on the reiterated <i>shevu‘ah</i>, vow.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2608">&zwnj;</a>the beginning of the barley harvest<span class="p">.

The antecedent of “them” is of course the corpses. As in the ancient Greek world, leaving a corpse unburied is a primal sacrilege, a final desecration of the sacredness of the human person. Rizpah, watching over the unburied corpses, is a kind of Hebrew Antigone. David had delivered the seven descendants of Saul to the Gibeonites with the single-minded intention of expiating the crime that had caused the famine. Evidently, he gave no thought to the possibility that the Gibeonites would desecrate the bodies of the Saulides after killing them by denying them burial.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="11."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2585" class="a" name="bookmark2611">And David was told what Rizpah . . . had </a>done<span class="p">.

In this strange story, David is seen handing over the surviving offspring of Saul to be killed, but only for the urgent good of the nation, after which he pays posthumous respect to the line of Saul. It is conceivable that this story reflects an alternative narrative tradition to the more politically complex one of the David story proper through which David is exonerated from what may well have been a widespread accusation that he deliberately liquidated all of Saul’s heirs, with the exception of Mephibosheth.</p></li><li data-list-text="15."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2588" class="a" name="bookmark2614">David grew </a>weary. <span class="p">This phrase probably indicates an aging David, though not yet the vulnerable sedentary monarch of the conflict with Absalom.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="16."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2615">&zwnj;</a>Ishbi-Benob<span class="p">.

So he is identified in the parallel report in Chronicles.

In the literary shaping of the story of David, a</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">triumph originally attributed, perhaps with good reason, to Elhanan was transferred to David and grafted onto the folktale pattern of the killing of a giant or an ogre by a resourceful young man.

It was a common literary practice in ancient Israel to place a long poem or “song” (<i>shirah</i>) at or near the end of a narrative book—compare Jacob’s Testament, Genesis 49, and the Song of Moses, Deuteronomy 32. In the case of the Book of Samuel, David’s victory psalm and Hannah’s psalm, respectively a song of the male warrior’s triumph and a song contextualized as an expression of maternal triumph, enclose the large narrative like bookends, and there is even some interechoing of language between the two poems. These long concluding poems were presumably selected by the editor or composer of the book from a variety of texts available in the literary tradition and then ascribed to a principal character of the story. There is, of course, a persistent biblical notion of David the poet as well as of David the warrior-king, and the idea that he actually composed this poem, though unlikely, cannot be categorically dismissed. In any case, most scholars (Albright, Cross and Friedman, Robertson) detect relatively archaic language in the poem and date it to the tenth century, David’s time. The archaic character of the language makes the meaning of many terms conjectural. Even in the ancient period, some of the older locutions may already have been obscure to the scribes, who seem to have scrambled many phrases in transmission; but in contrast to the confident practice of many biblical scholars, caution in presuming to reconstruct the “primitive” text is prudent. It should be noted that this same poem occurs in the Book of Psalms as Psalm 18, with a good many minor textual variants. In several instances, the reading in Psalm 18 seems preferable, but here, too, methodological caution is necessary: Psalm 18 appears to be a secondary version of the poem, and its editor at least in some cases may have clarified obscurities through revision.</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 16pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2624" class="a" name="bookmark2655">my crag and my </a>fortress<span class="p">. Albright notes that many of the Northwest Semitic gods were deified mountains. Thus the imagery of the god as a lofty rock or crag abounds in the poetic tradition upon which the biblical poet drew. It also makes particular sense for a poem of military triumph, since a warrior battling in the mountainous terrain of the land of Israel would keenly appreciate the image of protection of a towering cliff or a fortress situated on a height.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2656">&zwnj;</a>horn<span class="p">. The idiom is drawn from the goring horn of a charging ram or bull. In keeping with the precedent of the King James Version, it is worth preserving in English in order to suggest the concreteness and the archaic coloration of the poem.</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2626" class="s27" name="bookmark2657">5. </a><a href="#bookmark2626" class="a">For the breakers of death beset </a>me<span class="p">.

The poetic representation of God, drawing on pre- monotheistic  literary  traditions  such  as  the  Ugaritic  Baal  epic,  is  unabashedly anthropomorphic. One must be cautious, however, in drawing theological inferences from this fact. Modes of literary expression exert a powerful momentum beyond their original cultural contexts, as Milton’s embrace of the apparatus of pagan epic in <i>Paradise Lost </i>vividly demonstrates. The L<span class="s22">ORD </span>figures as a fierce warrior, like Baal, because that works evocatively as poetry. This God of earthquakes and battles breathes fire: in an intensifying narrative progression from one verset to the next and then from line to line, smoke comes out of His nostrils, His mouth spews fire, in His awesome incandescence coals ignite before Him, and then He begins his actual descent from on high.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2629" class="s27" name="bookmark2660">11. </a><a href="#bookmark2629" class="a">He mounted a cherub and </a>flew<span class="p">.

It is often claimed that verses 21–25 are a Deuteronomistic interpolation in the poem—that is, seventh century or later. The evidence is not entirely persuasive because the theological notion of God’s rewarding the innocence of the individual by rescuing him from grave danger is by no means a Deuteronomistic innovation, and adherence to “statutes” and “laws” (verse 23), though encouraged in the Deuteronomistic literary environment, is neither its unprecedented invention nor its unique linguistic marker.</span></p><ol id="l178"><li data-list-text="25."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2633" class="a" name="bookmark2664">by the cleanness of my </a><span class="s20">hands</span>. The Masoretic text has merely “by my cleanness” (<i>kevori</i>), but the parallel version in Psalm 18 shows <i>kevor yadai </i>“by the cleanness of my hands,” as do the Septuagint and other ancient translations of this line. The concrete juxtaposition of idioms anchored in body parts—“cleanness of hands” for “innocence” and “before Your eyes” for “in Your sight”—is characteristic of biblical usage.</p></li><li data-list-text="26."><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2634" class="a" name="bookmark2665">with the blameless warrior You are without </a><span class="s20">blame</span>. Many textual critics consider “warrior” to be an interpolation and either delete it or substitute for <i>gibor</i>, “warrior,” <i>gever</i>, “man.” The parallelism of these four versets, in each of which God, in a verb, answers in kind to the adjectivally defined human agent, is better preserved without “warrior.” The profession of blamelessness scarcely accords with David’s behavior in the body of the story.</p></li><li data-list-text="27."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2666">&zwnj;</a>twist and turn<span class="p">. This English phrase represents a single reflexive verb in the Hebrew. It is the sole instance in this series of four versets in which the verb describing God’s action has a root different from the adjective characterizing the kind of person to whom God responds, though there is still a manifest semantic connection between the two terms here, and this works quite nicely as a small variation on the pattern to conclude the series.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="28."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2636" class="a" name="bookmark2667">A lowly people You rescue, / You cast Your eyes down on the </a>haughty<span class="p">. The opposition between low and high is conventional in the poetry of Psalms—it also figures in Hannah’s Song—but is nonetheless effective. The speaker’s people is “lowly” in the sense that it is miserable, afflicted, endangered by superior forces. God on high looks down on the lofty who seem to have the upper hand and, as the triumphant images from verse 39 onward make clear, brings them low.</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2637" class="s27" name="bookmark2668">30. </a><a href="#bookmark2637" class="a">I rush a barrier . . . vault a </a>wall<span class="p">.

Although this phrase, </span>ma‘uzi <span class="s26">ḥ</span>ayil<span class="p">, is intelligible as it stands, the variant in Psalm 18, supported by the Qumran Samuel scroll, is more fluent and sustains a parallelism of verbs between the two halves of the line.

The verb here, <i>wayater</i>, is problematic. The most obvious construction would be as a term that generally means “to loosen,” though the syntactic link with “blameless” (there is no explicit “to be” in the Hebrew) is obscure. The version in Psalm 18 substitutes <i>wayiten</i>, “He made” (or “set”), but the use of that all-purpose verb may simply reflect the scribe’s bafflement with the original verb.</p></li><li data-list-text="34."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2640" class="a" name="bookmark2671">makes my legs like a gazelle’s, / and stands me on the </a><span class="s20">heights</span>. The swiftness of the gazelle accords nicely with the image in verse 30 of the warrior sprinting in assault against the ramparts of the foe. Standing secure on the heights, then, would mark the successful conclusion of his trajectory of attack: the victorious warrior now stands on the walls, or within the conquered bastion, of the enemy. The <i>ai </i>suffix of <i>bamotai</i>, “heights,” normally a sign of the first-person possessive, is an archaic, or poetic, plural ending. The sense proposed by some scholars of “my back [or, thighs?]” is very strained, and destroys the narrative momentum between versets that is a hallmark of biblical poetry.</p></li><li data-list-text="35."><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2641" class="a" name="bookmark2672">makes my arms bend a bow of </a><span style=" color: #00F;">bronze</span><span class="p">. The verb </span>ni<span class="s26">ḥ</span>at <span class="p">has not been satisfactorily explained, nor is its syntactic role in the clause clear. This translation, like everyone else’s, is no more than a guess, based on the possibility that the verb reflects a root meaning “to come down,” and so perhaps refers to the bending down of a bow.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="36."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2642" class="a" name="bookmark2673">Your battle </a><span class="s20">cry</span>. This noun, ‘<i>anotkha</i>, is still another crux. The least farfetched derivation is from the verbal steam ‘<i>-n-h</i>, which means either “to answer,” thus yielding a sense here of “answering power,” or “to call out,” “speak up.” Given the sequence of concrete warfare images in these lines, from bronze bow to saving shield, this translation proposes, conjecturally, “battle cry,” with the established verbal noun ‘<i>anot</i>, “noise” or “calling out” in mind. Compare Exodus 32:18: “The sound of crying out in triumph” (<i>qol ‘anot gevurah</i>). The battle cry would use God’s name (perhaps something like “sword of the L<span class="s22">ORD </span>and of David”) with the idea that it had a potency that would infuse the warrior with strength and resolution and strike fear in the enemy. Thus the battle cry makes the solitary fighter, or the handful he leads, “many” against seemingly superior forces.</p></li><li data-list-text="37."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2674">&zwnj;</a>You lengthened my stride beneath me, / and my ankles did not trip<span class="p">.

The English phrase, chosen to reflect the rhythmic compactness of the original, represents a Hebrew verb that means “to destroy them utterly,” or, “to finish them off,” but the former phrase is too much of a mouthful and the latter is the wrong level of diction. In any event, the narrative sequence of being provided with armor and weapons and charging against a fleeing enemy is now completed as the victor overtakes his adversaries and tramples them to death.</span></p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2645" class="s27" name="bookmark2676">42. </a><a href="#bookmark2645" class="a">there was none to rescue, / to the L</a><a href="#bookmark2645" class="s21">ORD</a><a href="#bookmark2645" class="a">, He answered them </a><span class="s20">not</span>.

The translation follows the minor variation of the parallel reading in Psalm 18, <i>merivey ‘am</i>, literally, “the strife of people.” The Masoretic text here reads <i>merivey ‘ami</i>, “the strife of my people,” which may simply mean the battles in which my people is embroiled, but it also inadvertently suggests internal strife.

All that can be said in confidence about the Hebrew verb is that it indicates something negative.

The meanings of both the verb and the noun are in dispute. The verb <span class="s26">ḥ</span><i>agar </i>usually means “to gird,” but the text in Psalm 18, more plausibly, inverts the second and third consonants, yielding <span class="s26">ḥ</span><i>arag</i>, which is generally taken to mean “emerge from,” or “pop out from,” a restrictive framework. The noun <i>misgerotam </i>is clearly derived from the root <i>s-g-r</i>, “to close,” and “fort” (an enclosure) seems fairly plausible.

Many critics have seen the entire concluding verse as an editorial addition, both because of the switch to a third-person reference to the king and because of the invocation of dynasty, beyond the temporal frame of the warrior-king’s own victories. The inference, however, is not inevitable. Switches in grammatical person, even in a single clause, occur much more easily in biblical Hebrew than in modern Western languages, and if the triumphant speaker of the poem is actually David or in any event is imagined to be David, it is quite possible that he would conclude his account of attaining imperial greatness by a prayer that the dynasty he has founded will continue to enjoy God’s

David’s victory psalm in the preceding chapter is now followed by a second archaic poetic text, quite different in style, unrelated to the psalm tradition, and a good deal obscurer in many of its formulations. Although there is scholarly debate about the dating of this poem, the consensus puts it in or close to David’s own time in the tenth century. The mystifying features of the language certainly suggest great antiquity, and it is just possible that the poet was really by David. The exact application of “the last words of David” is unclear. In terms of the narrative, they are not literally his last words because he will convey a deathbed testament to Solomon (1 Kings 2). The phrase might be intended to designate the last pronouncement in poetry of David the royal poet.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2686" class="a" name="bookmark2719">Thus spoke </a>David<span class="p">. This introductory formula is a mark of prophetic or oracular language—compare the beginning of Balaam’s third oracle in Numbers 24:3.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2687" class="a" name="bookmark2720">raised on </a><span class="s20">high</span>. The two Hebrew words reflected in this translation, <i>huqam ‘al</i>, have a gorgeous strangeness as compacted idiom—so strange that both the Septuagint and the Qumran Samuel prefer a more common Hebrew locution, <i>heqim ’el</i>, “God has raised up.” In either case, the phrase refers to David’s elevation to the throne.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2688" class="a" name="bookmark2721">sweet singer of </a><span class="s20">Israel</span>. The eloquent and famous wording of the King James Version (KJV) seems worth retaining because the divergent proposals for understanding the phrase are scarcely more certain than that of the KJV. The literal meaning of <i>ne‘im zemirot yisra’el </i>is “sweet one [or, favorite] of the chants of Israel.” The root <i>z-m-r </i>has a homonymous meaning—strength—which has encouraged some interpreters to construe this as “preferred of the Strong One [or, Stronghold] of Israel” in parallel to “anointed of the God of Israel.” It must be said, however, that there are no instances in which the root <i>z-m-r </i>in the sense of strength serves as an epithet for the deity.</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2689" class="a" name="bookmark2722">The L</a><a href="#bookmark2689" class="s21">ORD</a><a href="#bookmark2689" class="a">’</a><a href="#bookmark2689" class="s21">S </a><a href="#bookmark2689" class="a">spirit has spoken in </a>me<span class="p">.

The meaning of these images is much disputed, and some critics move “from radiance” altogether back to the preceding clause. The tentative reading presumed by the translation is as follows: The anointed king has been compared to the brilliant rising sun on a cloudless morning (solar imagery for kings being fairly common in ancient Near Eastern literature). The poet</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">now adds that from the sun’s radiance, coupled with rainfall, grass springs forth from the earth. Thus the rule of the just king is a source of blessed fruitfulness to his subjects.</p></li><li data-list-text="5."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2693" class="a" name="bookmark2726">For is not thus my house with </a>God? <span class="p">The Hebrew grammar here is a little confusing. It is most plausible to construe both this clause and the one at the end of the verse not as negative statements but as affirmative questions. The image of bringing to bloom in the concluding clause suggests that David’s dynasty in relation to God is to be imagined like the earth in relation to sun and showers and like the people in relation to the king: because of the everlasting covenant with David, God will make his house blossom.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="6."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2694" class="a" name="bookmark2727">the worthless man is like a thorn— / uprooted every </a><span class="s20">one</span>. The antithesis between flourishing soft grass and the prickly thorn torn from its roots is manifest (though it must be said that “uprooted” for the obscure <i>munad </i>is conjectural, if widely accepted).</p></li><li data-list-text="7."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2695" class="a" name="bookmark2728">he must get himself </a><span class="s20">iron</span>. The translation adopts the common proposal that the verb <i>yimale’ </i>(literally, “he will fill”) is an ellipsis for <i>yimale’ yado</i>, “he will fill his hand,” “equip himself with”). Others emend it to read ’im <i>lo’</i>, “except [with].”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2696" class="a" name="bookmark2729">or the shaft of a </a><span class="s20">spear</span>. The Hebrew is usually construed as “and the shaft,” but the particle <i>waw </i>does occasionally have the force of “or,” which is more plausible here.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2697" class="a" name="bookmark2730">in fire they’ll be utterly </a>burned<span class="p">. The only suitable disposition of these nasty thorns is to rake them up with an iron tool or a spear shaft and make a bonfire of them, in order to get entirely rid of the threat they pose. The fact that weapons are used for the raking suggests the political referent of the metaphor. Such will be the fate of mischief makers (“the  worthless”)—evidently  all  who  would  presume  to  oppose  the  legitimate monarchy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2698" class="a" name="bookmark2731">where they </a><span class="s20">are</span>. This phrase reflects a single, highly dubious word in the Masoretic text, <i>bashavet</i>. That word may well be an inadvertent repetition by a baffled scribe of the seventh Hebrew word in the following verse. The whole phrase in which that term occurs is itself textually problematic.</p></li><li data-list-text="8."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2699" class="a" name="bookmark2732">These are the names of the warriors of </a>David<span class="p">. This list of military heroes and their exploits is perhaps the strongest candidate of any passage in the Book of Samuel to be considered a text actually written in David’s lifetime. The language is crabbed, and the very abundance of textual difficulties, uncharacteristic for prose, reflects the great antiquity of the list. These fragmentary recollections of particular heroic exploits do not sound like the invention of any later writer but, on the contrary, like memories of remarkable martial acts familiar to the audience (for example, “he . . . killed the lion in the pit on the day of the snow”) and requiring only the act of epic listing, not of narrative elaboration. It should also be noted that the list invokes the early phase of David’s career—when the Philistines were the dominant military force in the land, when David was at Adullam and in “the stronghold,” and when Asahel, destined to perish at the hands of Abner at the beginning of the civil war, was an active member of David’s corp of elite fighters.</span></p></li></ol><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2699" class="a" name="bookmark2733">Josheb-Basshebeth a </a>Tahchemonite<span class="p">. So reads the Masoretic text. But this looks quite dubious as a Hebrew name. One version of the Septuagint has Ish-Baal (alternately, Jeshbaal), which by scribal euphemism also appears as Ish-Bosheth and hence may have produced the confusion in the Masoretic text. Many authorities prefer the gentilic “Hachmoni,” in accordance with the parallel verse in Chronicles.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2700" class="a" name="bookmark2734">the </a><span class="s20">Three</span>.

Or, “Would that I might drink water . . .” Bethlehem, of course, is David’s hometown, at this juncture a headquarters of the occupying Philistine forces. David expresses a sudden yen to taste the sweet water he remembers from that well by the gate of his native town, though he scarcely intends this as a serious invitation to his men to undertake anything so foolhardy as to attempt breaking through the Philistine lines in order to get it. Presumably, the three warriors—it is unclear as to whether they are identical with the Three just named, for they are said to be part of the Thirty—do not misunderstand David’s intentions. Rather, as daring fighters, they decide to take him at his word and risk their necks in raiding the Philistine garrison at Bethlehem in order to prove they can execute a seemingly impossible mission. It is easy to understand how such an exploit would be vividly recalled and registered in the epic list.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2707" class="s27" name="bookmark2741">17. </a><a href="#bookmark2707" class="a">Shall I drink the blood of </a>men<span class="p">. The verb (one word in the Hebrew) “shall I drink” is missing from the Masoretic text, though present in both the parallel verse in Chronicles and in the Septuagint.

The reason for God’s wrath is entirely unspecified, and attempts to link it to events in the preceding narrative are quite unconvincing. In fact, this entire narrative unit (which some scholars claim is itself composite) is strikingly different in theological assumptions, in its imagination of narrative situation and character, and even in its style from the David story proper as well as from the tale of David and the Gibeonites in Chapter 21 with which it is symmetrically paired. Perhaps, indeed, there is no discernible reason for God’s fury against Israel. The God of this story has the look of acting arbitrarily, exacting terrible human costs in order to be placated. Unlike the deity of 1 Samuel 1–2 Samuel 20, He is decidedly an interventionist God, pulling the human actors by strings,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and He may well be a capricious God, here “inciting” David to carry out a census that will only bring grief to the people.</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2753" class="a" name="bookmark2774">Joab, commander of the </a><span style=" color: #00F;">force</span><span class="p">.

Several commentators have noted that according to Exodus 30:12 every Israelite counted in a census was required to pay a half shekel as “ransom” (<i>kofer</i>) for his life. Since such payment could not be realistically expected in a total census of the nation, masses of people would be put in a condition of violation of ritual. But there is also a folkloric horror of being counted as a condition of vulnerability to malignant forces. In Rashi’s words: “For the evil eye holds sway over counting.” Beyond these considerations, Joab the commander may have a political concern in mind: the census served as the basis for conscription (compare the notation in verse 9 of those counted as “sword-wielding men”), and thus imposing the census might conceivably have provoked opposition to the threatened conscription and to the king who was behind it. It is noteworthy that the census is carried out by army officers.</p></li></ol><ol id="l187"><li data-list-text="5."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2755" class="a" name="bookmark2776">they crossed the Jordan and camped in </a>Aroer<span class="p">. Aroer is roughly fifteen miles east of the Dead Sea. The trajectory of the census takers describes a large ellipsis: first to the southeast from Jerusalem, then north through trans-Jordan to Gilead and beyond, then west through the northernmost Israelite territory to the sea, then all the way south to Beersheba, and back to Jerusalem. All this, which will lead to wholesale death, is accomplished in nine months and twenty days—the human gestation period.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="6."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2777">&zwnj;</a>Tahtim-Hodshi<span class="p">.

Gad was mentioned earlier (1 Samuel 22:5). His appearance here by no means warrants the claim of Kyle McCarter, Jr., and others that this story is the work of a “prophetic” writer. Visionary intermediaries between king and God were a common assumption in the ancient world. Gad is called “seer” (<span class="s26">ḥ</span><i>ozeh</i>), not the way prophetic writers would ordinarily think of prophets (and also not the term used for Samuel in 1 Samuel 9). Above all, the prophetic current in biblical literature does not presuppose either this kind of arbitrarily punitive God or the accompanying hocus- pocus with choices of punishment and divine messengers of destruction visible to the human characters.</p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="14."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2761" class="a" name="bookmark2782">Let us . . . fall into the L</a><a href="#bookmark2761" class="s21">ORD</a><a href="#bookmark2761" class="a">’</a><a href="#bookmark2761" class="s21">S </a><a href="#bookmark2761" class="a">hand . . . and into the hand of man let me not </a>fall<span class="p">. There is a puzzle in David’s choice because only one of the three punishments—the flight from enemies—clearly involves human agency. Perhaps David has in mind that an extended famine would lead to absolute dependence on those foreign nations unaffected by the famine, as in the story of Joseph’s brothers going down to Egypt. In all this, it should be noted that David is scarcely the same character we have seen in the body of his story. Instead of that figure of conflicting feelings and emotions so remarkable in psychological depth, we have a flat character instigated to act by God, then expressing remorse, then speaking in rather official tones in his role as political ruler and cultic chief responsible for all the people.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="15."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2762" class="a" name="bookmark2783">the fixed </a><span class="s20">time</span>. There is some question about what this refers to, though the grounds for emending the text to solve the problem are shaky. The phrase ought logically to refer to the end of the ordained three days of the plague. Yet David’s intercession to stop the plague short before it engulfs Jerusalem suggests that the plague does not go on for the full three days. The difficulty might be resolved simply by assuming that the initial verb—“and the L<span class="s22">ORD </span>sent a plague against Israel”—refers to the initiating of the process according to the promised time limitations: God sends a plague against Israel intended to rage for the stipulated time of three days, but after it has devastated the people on a terrible scale for a certain time (perhaps two days?), David, aghast that these horrors should visit his own city as well, takes steps to induce God to cut the plague short.</p></li><li data-list-text="16."><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2763" class="a" name="bookmark2784">And the messenger reached out his hand against Jerusalem to destroy </a><span class="s20">it</span>. Once again, the apparatus and the theology of this story reflect a different imaginative world from that of the main narrative about David, in which there are no divine emissaries of destruction brandishing celestial swords. The text of the Qumran Samuel scroll, paralleled in 1 Chronicles 21, makes the mythological character of this story even clearer: “and David raised his eyes and saw a messenger of the L<span class="s22">ORD </span>standing between earth and heaven, his sword unsheathed in his hand reaching out against Jerusalem, and David and the elders fell on their faces, covered with sackcloth.”</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2785">&zwnj;</a>stay your hand<span class="p">.

In this fashion, the last-minute averting of the destruction of Jerusalem is linked with the etiological tale explaining how the site of the future temple was acquired. (Although the temple is not explicitly mentioned, this acquisition of an altar site in Jerusalem is clearly placed here to prepare the way for the story of Solomon the temple builder that is to follow.) Thus, the first sacrifice offered on this spot is associated with a legendary turning away of wrath from Jerusalem—a token of the future function of the temple. The name Araunah it is not Semitic and is generally thought to be Hittite or Hurrian. Some scholars claim it is a title, not a name. In any event, Araunah’s presence indicates that the conquered Jebusites were not massacred or entirely banished but continued to live in Jerusalem under David as his subjects.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="17."><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark2766" class="a" name="bookmark2787">It is I who </a>offended<span class="p">.

In this whole exchange, there is a distinct parallel to Abraham’s bargaining with Ephron the Hittite for the purchase of a grave site at Hebron in Genesis 23.

This is, of course, a near-verbatim repetition of the words that conclude the story of David and the Gibeonites’ execution of the descendants of Saul (21:14). The repetition may well be an editorial intervention intended to underscore the symmetry between the tale of a scourge averted by David’s intercession at the beginning and at the end of this large composite coda to 1 and 2 Samuel. Although neither of these stories is especially continuous with the David story proper, both reflect a connection with it in the emphasis on guilt that the king incurs, which brings disaster on the nation and which requires expiation. But the writer of genius responsible for the larger David narrative imagines guilt in far more probing moral terms and does not assume that the consequences of moral offenses and grave political misjudgments can be reversed by some ritual act.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 225pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">KINGS</p><p style="padding-left: 225pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">TO THE READER</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3">T</span>HE <span class="s4">B</span>OOK OF <span class="s4">K</span>INGS, <span class="s4">like the Book of Samuel, as Josephus and early rabbinic sources indicate, was originally one book, not two. Its first two chapters, moreover,  are  clearly  a  completion  of  the  story  of  David,  showing  the masterful hand of the great writer who fashioned the long narrative of Israel’s founding king. The ancient editors set this material at the beginning of the Book of Kings because it reports Solomon’s accession to the throne, though that story is intertwined with the wrenching portrait of the aging and failing David and his troubled relationship with his henchman Joab and his actual and  potential  enemies  within  and  without  the  court.  Once  this  story  is completed,  the  Book  of  Kings  proper  exhibits  an  approach  to  politics, character, and historical causation that is quite different from the one that informs the David story.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Kings proves to be the most miscellaneous of the books assembled as the</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">Former Prophets, though all of them are composite at least to some degree. The encompassing redactional framework is patently Deuteronomistic. The measure of every king is whether he did evil in the eyes of the L<span class="s13">ORD</span>, and doing evil, with only a few limited exceptions, is conceived in cultic terms. The Deuteronomistic compiler repeatedly invokes the stipulation that there can be only one legitimate place of worship, which is the temple in Jerusalem</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">—an idea that became firmly entrenched only with King Josiah’s reforms around 621 BCE, scant decades before the Babylonian exile. Through most of these stories, the editor holds clearly in view the destruction of the Northern Kingdom of Israel in 721 BCE and evidently also the destruction of the Southern Kingdom of Judah in 586 BCE. Since there is no hint, even at the end of the narrative, of any return to Zion after the exile, scholars have plausibly inferred that the book as a whole was put together in the early decades after the destruction of Judah.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">It was put together, however, from a variety of widely disparate sources, which is why it is best to think of the person or persons responsible for its final form as a compiler or compilers. The large unit at the very beginning (1 Kings 1–11) in itself illustrates the composite character of the book as a whole. The first two chapters, as I have noted, belong to the end of the David</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">story, exhibiting its brilliant deployment of dialogue and of techniques of narrative repetition and its shrewd sense of <i>Realpolitik</i>. Chapter 3 begins with an emphatically theological story of God’s appearance to Solomon in a dream and the king’s request for the gift of wisdom. This encounter with the divine is followed in the second half of the chapter by the often recalled Judgment of Solomon,  a  fable  obviously  meant  to  illustrate  his  wisdom  and  clearly reflecting a different narrative genre, the folktale. Chapter 4 is a roster of Solomon’s royal bureaucracy, quite different from anything that precedes it.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">The first half of Chapter 5 is taken up with a report of the material grandeur of  Solomon’s  court  and  of  his  unsurpassed  wisdom,  manifested  in  his composition of proverbs and poems. The next two and half chapters focus on Solomon’s great building projects, the temple and the palace, undertaken with the collaboration of Hiram king of Tyre. Chapter 8 recounts the dedication of the temple, most of it being the grand speech delivered by Solomon on that occasion (and deemed by many scholars to be a later composition). Chapter 9 begins with God’s theologically freighted response to Solomon, then moves on to more of his royal projects. In Chapter 10 we get the enchanting folktale of the visit to Solomon’s court of the queen of Sheba. The following chapter, the last in Solomon’s story, switches gears to show us the hitherto exemplary king led into the encouraging of pagan practices by his sundry foreign wives. At the very end of the Solomon narrative, the editor informs us that “The rest of the acts of Solomon and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon?” (1 Kings 11:42). We may infer that at least some of the material in Chapters 3–11 was drawn from this source, which seems to have been some sort of court annal. The reports of the royal  bureaucracy  and  of  Solomon’s  building  projects,  including  a  great abundance of architectural details and catalogues of furnishings, and of his marriage  to  Pharaoh’s  daughter,  are  likely  candidates  for  this  annalistic source. Other sources appear to have been tapped for the two folktales and probably also for the account at the end of Solomon’s backsliding into pagan ways.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The sundry stories of the kings that come after the Solomon narrative</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">approximately follow this pattern of drawing together disparate documents. More than any other narrative book of the Bible, the stories in Kings are repeatedly  and  insistently  framed  by  formulaic  declarations.  Wayward monarchs being preponderant, one king after another is said to swerve from the ways of the L<span class="s13">ORD</span>, and in the case of the northern kingdom, to follow the dire path of its founder, Jeroboam son of Nebat, who offended and led Israel</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">to offend. Again and again, the compiler, with his overriding concern for the exclusivity of the cult in the Jerusalem temple, inveighs against both northern and southern kings in formulaic language for allowing the people to burn incense and offer sacrifice on “the high places,” that is, local rural altars. And the story of each king is concluded, like Solomon’s, by a notation that the rest of the acts of this monarch are recorded in the Book of the Acts of the Kings of Judah or the Book of the Acts of the Kings of Israel, depending on whether the king is southern or northern.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">The reasonable inference from this editorial procedure is that much of the factual material of the Book of Kings was drawn from these two annalistic sources, one for the Kingdom of Judah and the other for the Kingdom of Israel. There is no way of knowing how much of the two lost annals was left out  of  the  canonical  text,  though  it  seems  likely  that  a  good  deal  of circumstantial detail about the various kings was deemed irrelevant to this narrative, encompassing four centuries of Israelite history, that is meant to expound the cumulative chain of actions that led to two nationally traumatic events, the destruction of the northern kingdom in 721 BCE and, 135 years later, the destruction of its southern counterpart.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">But we should not think of the Book of Kings merely as a series of extracts from two sets of royal annals. The Deuteronomistic editor provides a good deal of interpretation of the events, especially in his repeated insistence that cultic disloyalty to YHWH brought about the national catastrophes, and in all likelihood he also introduces some of his own narrative invention in order to support  his  interpretation  of  the  history  he  conveys.  Beyond  these interventions, he incorporates materials from sources that are clearly not annalistic. In the later chapters of 2 Kings, there are a few extended passages taken directly from a narrative section of Isaiah, and, at the very end, a short section is drawn from Jeremiah (though it may be the other way around—that the two prophetic books drew from Kings). Elsewhere, there are numerous stories about prophets—not “writing prophets” but men of God who roam the countryside and are active players in the political realm—that have a strong folkloric stamp. Scholars have conjectured that there were collections of tales about  prophets,  probably  produced  in  prophetic  circles,  which  the  later compiler decided to include in the large narrative. However, the fact that these stories are about prophets does not necessarily mean that they were the product of a prophetic milieu, and I would propose that what is most salient about them is their generic character as folktales—stories spun out by the</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">people awestruck by the remembered or imagined powers of these men of God.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">There is, in fact, a palpable tension between the narrative of the kings and the tales of the prophets, however they intersect. The royal narrative appears to be historical, at least in its broad outlines. The kingdom did split in two after the death of Solomon around 930 BCE. There is no reason to doubt the reports of chronic political instability, especially in the northern kingdom where there was no authorized dynasty, involving a long and bloody sequence of court conspiracies, assassinations of kings, and usurpations. Israel’s and Judah’s  struggles  with  the  Arameans,  the  Assyrians,  and  finally  the Babylonians were actual historical events, many of them attested in the Assyrian  and  Babylonian  annals  that  have  been  uncovered  by  modern archeology. The compiler of Kings, then, registers the course of historical events in the two kingdoms, making efforts to synchronize their chronology with  reference  to  regnal  spans,  though  his  commitment  to  theological historical causation leads him occasionally to introduce a supernatural event into the historical account. Thus, the Assyrian emperor Sennacherib did in fact conduct a campaign against Judah and neighboring regions toward the end of the seventh century BCE and laid siege against Jerusalem in 601 BCE, then  withdrew  for  reasons  that  remain  uncertain.  The  author  of  Kings, however, chooses to represent the lifting of the siege as the result of an act of divine intervention in which the Assyrian army is suddenly stricken with a mysterious plague. This retreat of the Assyrian forces confirms his view that Jerusalem is a divinely protected city, the exclusive place that God has chosen to set his name upon. In this view, it is only the pagan outrages and the murderous  practices  of  King  Manasseh  that  later  tip  the  balance  and determine the destruction of Jerusalem.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: justify;">If the accounts of the kings are by and large historical, the tales of the</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">prophets—preeminently, the cycle of stories about Elijah and Elisha—abound in displays of supernatural powers that set them off not only from the royal history but also from virtually everything that precedes them in the Book of Samuel. Fire is brought down from the heavens to consume a sacrifice in a confrontation with the prophets of Baal; a dead child is revived; a cruse of oil becomes bottomless to provide for a destitute widow; a precious borrowed axehead, sunk in the Jordan, floats to the surface; Elijah does not die but ascends in a chariot of fire to the heavens. In the actual miracle-count, Elisha somewhat surpasses his master Elijah, but it is Elijah who is embraced by later  tradition,  singled  out  at  the  end  of  Malachi  as  the  man  who  will</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">announce the coming of the redeemer; serving as a model for the Gospel writers  in  their  stories  of  the  miraculous  acts  performed  by  Jesus;  and becoming a cherished folk-hero in later Jewish tradition. It is Elijah rather than Elisha who enjoys this vivid afterlife because he is the master, not the disciple, and perhaps also because he is finally the more sympathetic figure of the two—it is hard to forget Elisha’s initial act of sending bears to devour the boys who mock him, an event that already caused discomfort among the early rabbis.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">The Elijah stories, it should be said, are not only a chronicle of signs and wonders but the representation of a rather arresting character. First we see him in flight, hiding out from Ahab’s wrath. Then he shows himself as the iron- willed spokesman of God, denouncing Ahab to his face as “the troubler of Israel.” After his triumph over the Baal prophets on Mount Carmel, finding himself nevertheless again mortally threatened by Ahab and Jezebel, he flees to the wilderness where he despairs, asking God, “Enough, now, L<span class="s13">ORD</span>. Take my life, for I am no better than my fathers” (1 Kings 19:4). But the despair is countered by the epiphany vouchsafed him in the wilderness, and he climbs back from his nadir again to confront Ahab after the judicial murder of Naboth contrived by Jezebel—“Have you murdered and also taken hold?” (1 Kings 21:19).</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: justify;">In all this, as in the Samson stories and elsewhere in the Bible, the folktale</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">fondness for wondrous acts is interfused with a subtle narrative art in which dialogue, cunning patterns of repetition, and intimations of the character’s inwardness are impressively deployed. Among all the narratives of monarchs, southern and northern, in the Book of Kings, pride of place is accorded to two characters—King  Solomon  and  Elijah  the  prophet.  Solomon  is  the embodiment of the regal grandeur of Israel’s divinely elected monarchy, and as such great attention is lavished on his wealth, his grand royal enterprises, and his wisdom. He, like Elijah, will survive in later tradition as a figure both unmatched and revered. At the end of his story, he is seen falling away from his high calling, thus providing a rationale for the dividing of the kingdom and, ultimately, for its destruction. Elijah’s story ends in a fiery ascent, assuring his future standing as the harbinger of the messiah and the folk-hero who will come to the wretched of his people in their hour of distress.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The compiler who put Kings together for posterity above all sought to</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">provide an account of the nation’s history and an explanation of why that history took the course it finally did. The artful crafting of narrative was not one of his conscious aims. The deep-seated storytelling impulse, however,</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">that drives so much biblical narrative manifests itself in this book as well, in some degree in the luminous tales about King Solomon and even more in the cycle of stories marked by confrontation, triumph, and dejection about Elijah the Tishbite.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 223pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">1 Kings</p><p style="padding-left: 223pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/></body></html>
